Pushpakumara to comment on the issue but our efforts turned futile.However Lanka Teachers Association Secretary Joseph Starlin said that the minister and the examination commissioner general should resign if they are involved in an independent examination system. UPDATE: Friday, 30 May 2014 - 07:31 PM----------------------------------------------UNP replies to Minister Bandula.The UNP says that Education Minister Bandula Gunawardana is ignorant of memorandums of understanding and agreements.Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo this morning, UNP MP Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that Minister Gunawardana’s reply to Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe’s statement with regard to the MoU with the IMF is clear proof to his ignorance.Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe told a media briefing held at his office recently that the government has entered a MoU with the IMF to slash allocation for education in the country.Education Minister Bandula Gunawardana convened a media briefing to reply to the Opposition Leader’s statement with regard to IMF.However UNP MP Akila Viraj Kariyawasam stated that the opposition leader will make a statement over the weekend."

According to this MoU, with the abolition of SAITM, SLIIT, a leading non-state, not-for-profit degree awarding institute, will establish the new sunset and sunrise institutions, under the guidance of the Government that will take over ownership and management of SAITM’s assets, liabilities, staff and students. The statement added that subject to the approval of the Attorney General’s Department, this MoU will be converted into a legal agreement.This solution resolves both concerns raised by various groups, it added. They are: * SAITM does not meet Sri Lanka’s high standards for medical education* SAITM’s profit motive will pervert the goal of creating good doctors* Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), which establishes and maintains national standards for the medical profession, proposed a thorough set of Minimum Standards for Medical Education and Training that was accepted by the Cabinet with minor amendments on 13.12.2017 * This filled a major void in ensuring high standards of medical education* Medical education and training of the ‘sunset’ institution will be approved by the SLMC in accordance with the Minimum Standards. The SLMC will specify further measures (clinical training and assessment in state hospitals) necessary for students who have received degrees from SAITM, to meet these Standards and thereby gain Provisional Registration* SLMC will grant fresh approval for the ‘sunrise’ institution upon its meeting Minimum Standards, through an institutional review and site visits as per their mandate and standard practice for this purpose* The ‘sunset’ and ‘sunrise’ institutions will not operate for profit. The ‘sunrise’ institution will be a company limited by guarantee that charges fees, but re-invests any excess income over expenditure in the institution, including in the provision of scholarships based on financial need. SLIIT is an ideal partner in this effort, with two decades of experience in providing high-quality, not-for-profit higher education* Thus this practical and equitable solution recognizes, addresses, and resolves the concerns expressed against SAITM, and is fully compliant with the Communiqué issued by the President on 29.10.2017* Additionally, the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital will be transferred to the Ministry of Health, allowing the State medical sector to gain a Rs. 3.2 billion assets at no cost to the StateThe Department of Government Information said that the solution has the unanimous approval of the 9-member Committee, which was Chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs."

                    "content": "The government has decided to abolish SAITM which is owned by Dr Neville Fernando and convert it to a not-for-profit institute.Issuing a communique, the Department of Government Information said it will be functioned under the Ministry of Higher Education and University Grants Commission.Accordingly, new enrollments to SAITM will be stopped and new enrollments will be made only after the new entity is established which will have minimum standards required for medical education.The Presidential Committee to resolve issues related to the faculty of medicine of SAITM, after considering the recommendations made by numerous stakeholders, has presented eight proposals to arrive at a permanent solution that is reasonable to all stakeholders and is in line with the government policy. First Proposal:Abolishing the medical faculty of SAITM. This shall be done in a manner legally acceptable to the current shareholders, lending institutions and the new entity interested in taking over all operations and management of the medical faculty of SAITM on a not-for-profit basis, thus ending the ownership and management structure of the medical faculty of SAITM. The profit-oriented entity owned and managed by Dr Neville Fernando and family would thereby cease to exist. Second Proposal:By an agreement reached by the above parties, the assets, liabilities, staff and students of SAITM medical faculty shall be transferred to a non-state, not-for-profit making degree awarding entity that will comply with the minimum standards of medical education and training. Third Proposal: The Government has consulted several already established non-state, not-for-profit entities with the objective of establishing the proposed not-for-profit entity for this purpose. Detailed discussions in this regard with interested parties shall start very soon. Fourth Proposal:The new entity shall recognize all students currently enrolled at SAITM medical faculty who possess the required entry qualifications. Opportunity will be afforded to these students to continue medical education in the proposed new institution. Fifth Proposal:Issues in respect of former students who have completed their degree course at SAITM medical faculty should be addressed on the advice of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, based on the determination of the Supreme Court case filed on the same. Arrangements shall be made for the said students who have completed the degree at SAITM medical faculty to undergo clinical training at recommended government hospitals. Sixth Proposal:Admission of medical students to SAITM medical faculty has been suspended by the letter issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education on the 15th of September 2017. This suspension will continue to be in effect. Accordingly, all new admissions shall be made to the new entity, when only complying with the minimum standards of medical education and training. The Government shall cooperate on all endeavours to make available, through financial institutions, subsidized student loan schemes to eligible students from low-income families to meet the cost of tuition and fees. Seventh Proposal:Current shareholders of SAITM medical faculty shall not participate in the ownership or management of the new entity. The cooperation of Dr Neville Fernando and family is extremely important in this regard. Eighth Proposal:The Ministry of Health shall gazette and place before Parliament the agreed minimum standards for medical education and training based on the draft submitted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council, upon conclusion of discussions with the SLMC, the Hon. Attorney General and other relevant stakeholders. This task must be mandatorily completed within one month from today. The communiqué further noted that a committee of high-level officials will be appointed to implement the proposed measures and that the entire process should be completed mandatorily by the end of this year."

Justice Khemaa Swarnaa-dhipathi said that in most cases such children are subjected to such situations more than once.The Justice pointed out further that the absence of sexual education to children is also a reason for the increase in child abuse incidents.A special High Court was set up at the Anuradhapura Court Complex one and a half years ago for considering cases connected with child abuse incidences and terrorist activities."

Amaradeva saddened not just his fans in Sri Lanka but the world too.\r\nHonorary Lecturer in Education in University of Birmingham, England, Christopher Robertson who has worked in Sri Lanka, is one such person. He shared his cherished memories of late Pandith Amaradeva with Hiru News.  \r\nMr. Robertson has worked with the UK based organisation Voluntary Service Overseas, at the Prithipura Communites 'project' to support the development of education, independent living and employment opportunities for disabled children and young people in Sri Lanka.\r\nDuring his stay here, he has worked in Asokapura, a rural village in Kegalle district, which could be reached only on foot. In 1977 “an uphill walk of a few miles from the local hamlet of Kehelpannala”, he said.\r\nMr. Robertson had wanted to run a rural music event at Asokapura. This was for the disabled children and young people living there, but also local farmers and villagers.\r\n“I knew and loved Pandith Amaradeva's music from the radio and decided to contact him directly in Colombo to ask if he might consider playing a concert at Asokapura,” he said adding, “To my amazement, he agreed, and said that he would travel to the community on the agreed date.”\r\nAfter the event was arranged Pandith Amaradeva has arrived for the concert with a band.\r\nMr. Robertson remembered that the walk to Asokapura was tiring for late Pandith Amaradeva.\r\n“However, after taking some refreshment, he and his fellow musicians were ready to perform. It was late in day and close to sunset, but with hastily constructed lighting in place and rudimentary amplification we were ready to go,” he writes.   “The concert lasted for a couple of hours and I shall never forget Pandit's wonderful rendition of Pawena nil walawa, as it floated underneth a starry sky and across the valley below. I shall never forget it, and I am sure the concert remained in the hearts of the local community for years to come.”\r\nMr. Robertson said these were “wonderful memories, of a wonderful musician and man of ordinary people”."

British Trading and Agency houses which were manned by Expatriate staff had commenced recruiting Sri Lankan executives, and Jasi was in the first batch at Harrisons, the others being Douglas Fonseka, Satchi Canagasabey and John Hitchcock. His career flourished at Harrisons and he was responsible for the Import and Export business carried out by the firm.In 1956 significant social changes followed in the country. This was a period of concerted Union activities and labour unrest.  The Trincomalee Tea Administration Board was formed to divert Tea exports through Trincomalee, thus avoiding the strife torn Colombo harbour. Jasi was one of the senior executives seconded by the export firm to run this operation in Trinco. When British expatriates in Colombo and in the Plantations started leaving the island, Jayasingam, had by then proved his mettle and was appointed the Chief Accountant, being one of the top three positions in running the Company.The next major change in his career was in 1975, when companies registered outside Sri Lanka had to register themselves with the Registrar of Companies in Colombo. Harrisons & Crossfields complied by registering their Colombo based operations and assets in a wholly owned subsidiary under the name of Harrisons Colombo Ltd. Jasi was a founder director of this Board and also its first Joint Managing Director. Soon Jayasingam assumed the position of Chairman of both Harrisons Colombo Ltd. and Harrisons Lister Colombo Ltd. He continued in this position until 1990 when he retired from Harrisons when Harrisons & Crossfields in London divested themselves of the shares in the local Company.On retirement he was invited to join the Boards of EB Creasy and Lankem Ceylon and several other Companies of the Fort Land Group. The privatization of Plantations saw him spearheading the diversification of the Group into Plantation Management. "

She returned to Sri Lanka in 2013 along with her husband and the children.\r\n“We wanted to raise our children in the right way” is her answer why she and her husband decided to come back. “And, that’s not possible in a camp for refugees,” she says nonchalantly. Her parents and younger sister are still in camps of Karur and Coimbatore. “I won’t compel them to return. The decision should be theirs,” she points out.\r\nAngamuthu Vanniyamoorthy, a 61-year-old farmer of Nagal Iluppaikulam of the Vavuniya district, has been able to rehabilitate himself swiftly on his return since 2012 even though he was away for 22 years. Thanks to the help from OfERR (Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation) and others, his daughter, who was born in Tamil Nadu when he and his family were in a Krishnagiri camp, has been given the citizenship of Sri Lanka. “Before returning to Sri Lanka, one has to ensure that one has all the important documents including birth certificates. There shouldn’t be any difficulty in getting citizenship here for one’s children,” he says, adding that not many follow this and complain later.\r\nBut, Sivaguru Premachandran, a tailor by profession, who came back to Jaffna four years ago after 17 years, is not on the side of Nirmala Devis and Vanniyamoorthys. Repenting his decision, he wonders: “Why one should return? For everything from entertainment to education to health care to art and culture, we, in the Northern Province, invariably look to Tamil Nadu,” he says.\r\nHe took the decision to return only after finding out from his relatives and friends about the situation. Like many others, he wanted to shed the tag of “refugee” and lead the rest of his life with honour and dignity. However, he admits that he and his wife have not been able to adapt themselves to the Jaffna environment after a prolonged displacement.\r\nNorthern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran says many refugee-returnees are “disillusioned.” He also contends that in respect of refugees living in Tamil Nadu who hail from Mullativu and Vavuniya, despite them holding land ownership documents, permits have been cancelled and Sinhalese have been settled there. This has to be reversed to enable voluntary repatriation of such refugees. (The Hindu reports)"

We have signed for one year of the trial period. The first balloon just entered Sri Lanka and we landed and there was a controversy saying that it was a crash landing. What we say and what the Google has claimed is that it was safely landed. Unfortunately there is a misconception that it had fallen down and it was crash landed but, well, Google has confirmed in letters and in emails that they are happy about the landing.\r\nHowever, there will be another balloon going up on the 30th in Sigiriya. Where we have the National Youth Camp. Where about 5000 youth will be there and we will be exhibiting the balloon and we will give the technical details about how it works and how it comes down.\r\nWhat is significant is what the Google Loon will do to Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka will be the only country, the first country where the entire country will have 4G LT technology in the whole world.\r\n\r\nWhat is the benefit of this project to an average Sri Lanka? Are the internet prices going to be cheap?\r\nYes, absolutely. The prices of data is going to be very cheap. When you have 10Mbps coverage, what you have on your phone right now is less than 2-3Mbps, downloading speeds. That’s very slow. We are not looking at what we are doing right now. Not checking Facebook or downloading music videos. What we are looking is at our children.\r\nWe are starting a pilot project and give every student an iPad in nine schools in nine provinces. All the students and teachers will start communicating with each other on the iPads. That’s a digital e-learning/ e-concept that we are working with Microsoft and Guru.lk, it’s a content provider, and they will start this project. It’s the next level of education and the child will grow their knowledge into a different level.\r\nScroll down to watch the full interview"

I bless you and congratulate you for the service you will be rendering to create the changes topically necessary for the betterment of the country.\r\nWe have a very long journey to make. It is definitely not going to be smooth. I became the President, Mr Ranil Wickramasinghe became the PM and you all obtained ministerial posts, not to perform duties of an easygoing, relaxed sort. We all admit the toughness and the challenging nature of politics.\r\nOne could engage in serene politics with the acquisition of power. Yet immorality would emerge along with that serene political agenda. We must engage in challenging work, retaining the toughness. We do all that for the country and the public.   I’m obliged to you for agreeing to the SLFP and the UNP working together for a certain period of time. From the very beginning our path was not smooth. Some say that the PM and myself have been trapped in an Imperialist plot…I will not answer that yet. We shall respond through our work in the future, and prove that we truly love the country.\r\nWe will succumb to no foreign influence. We will not despoil the prestigious history of this country. Whether it be Buddhists, Christians Hindus or Muslims, all talk about the congregation and separation of people for the good of people.    The national government concept was introduced for the betterment of the country. Considering the combination of this government some say that it will not last long..  No one must expect a government before 2020. Whatever anyone might say, our government is the stable one. No one will be allowed to change it - I assert that point.  Our effort is to build the country with the combination of the two parties. We transformed the ignoble political culture that was in operation for the past few decades. Therefore we must all resolve with responsibility to perform our duties true to our conscience and abstain from all sorts of corruption.\r\nPM Ranil Wickramasinghe addressing the newly appointed State and Deputy Ministers: \r\nWe have got over the initial step of establishing the national government. The cabinet assembled and the initial discussion was held as well. This is a political revolution – two parties coordinating according to an agreement. The public expects the national government to provide solutions to the problems faced by them.  \r\nWe who are now gathered here in this manner, used to be constantly at tug-of-war divided into two factions. We must coordinate and proceed together. We must consider the ideas of both the TNA and the JVP. We have a new journey to make.\r\nThere were those who shirked their duties despite all the perks they enjoyed. This cannot happen anymore. The public handed over to us the responsibility of working for the country. Traveling abroad must be limited. We’ll get to work now.\r\nOur President was appointed on the 8th of January to initiate good governance. We have discussed together and covered up a large area of work. We shall solve our problems through discussions within our parties. Eventually we can be satisfied that we fulfilled our obligations for the country.\r\n\r\n19 State Ministers and 21 Deputy Ministers took oaths today\r\nAccordingly the total number of State and Deputy Ministers sworn in today is 40.\r\n\r\nThe three Deputy Ministers absent from the swearing-in ceremony:\r\nSiripala Gamlath - Deputy Minister - Foreign Employment\r\nAnuradha Lanka Jayaratne - Deputy Minister – Mahaweli Development and Environment\r\nSarathee Dushmantha - Deputy Minister - Justice\r\n\r\n19 State Ministers were sworn-in today\r\nSudarshani Fernandopulle - State Minister - Water Supply\r\nWasantha Senanayake - State Minister – Irrigation and Water Management\r\nWasantha Aluvihare - State Minister - Agriculture\r\nVasantha Senanayake - State Minister - Highways\r\nSujeewa Serasinghe - State Minister - International Trade\r\nWijekala Maheshwaran - State Minister - Child Affairs\r\nChampika Premadasa - State Minister - Industries\r\nMohan Lal Grero - State Minister - University education\r\nHisbullah - State Minister - Resettlement & Rehabilitation\r\nRuwan Wijewardane - State Minister – Defense\r\nNiroshan Perera - State Minister - National Policy Economy\r\nDilip Wedaarachi - State Minister - Fisheries & Water Resources\r\nPalitha Range Bandara - State Minister - Vocational Training\r\nV Radakrishnan - State Minister- Education\r\nRaveendra Samaraweera - State Minister - Labor\r\nLaxman Yapa - State Minister - Finance\r\nPriyankara Jayaratne - State Minister - Law & Order\r\nT.B.

                    "content": "Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe says Sri Lanka needs to raise Rs. 3.4 trillion in 2018 and 2019 for debt servicing.\r\nHe said this presenting the government's Economic Policy Statement in Parliament today.\r\nHe also said over 60% of Sri Lanka's workforce is engaged either in informal or illegal economic activities.\r\nHe added that 40% of the employed population is engaged in vulnerable categories of jobs. \r\nFull text of Economic Policy Statement of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\r\nHon. Speaker,\r\nI take this opportunity to clarify the current status of the economy and the way forward for our government and people.\r\nI emphasized the need for rebuilding the Sri Lankan Economy when I delivered the Economic Policy Statements in 2015 and 2016.\r\nThe challenge faced by us today is to sustain what we have built and strengthening the economy. This task has two prongs.\r\nThe first is to stabilize the economy creating a country free of debt for our future generations. The second is to expand the economy giving all Sri Lankans the chance for prosperity.\r\nStrengthening and Expanding the Economy\r\nWe inherited a plagued economy. Since 2015, our Government took a number of major steps to stabilize the economy.\r\nAs I mentioned in the Economic Policy Statement last year, there is no use of holding the past responsible. We should try our best to go forward getting the past faults rectified.\r\nDespite the reasons which are beyond our control and challenging domestic and global conditions, we were able to sustain a steady GDP growth rate of 4.4%. We were able to maintain the unemployment rate at 4.2% and to reduce the budget deficit to 5.4%.\r\nPerhaps the most important thing is the change of our focus than the statistics. We focused on a development based on tradable goods rather than developing on non-tradable goods.\r\nFor years, the growth of the Economy of Sri Lanka was heavily reliant on huge public investments in infrastructure. Only the industries such as construction industry were strengthened by such investments. Concurrently, the exports share of the GDP of Sri Lanka was decreased gradually.\r\nManaging the National Debt\r\nWe inherited the challenge of high debt with deficits in our current account balance and the government budget. Years of low government revenue paired with rigid expenditure flows led to financing the budget deficit from domestic and foreign borrowings.\r\nIn 2015, 90.6% of the Government total revenue was spent for debt servicing. This amounted to 80% in 2016.It is an urgent need to draw our attention on spending more than the revenue. We have initiated a process of fiscal consolidation based on revenue generation by passing the Inland Revenue Act, which is already yielding returns.\r\nPublic finances have been strengthened and revenue has increased as a percentage of GDP during the past two years. The ratio of revenue to GDP in 2016 increased to 14.2% from 11.4% in 2014.\r\nFor the first six months of 2017, revenue to GDP now stands at 6.7% of GDP from 6% in the corresponding period in 2016. It is expected to reduce the current debt which is 79.3% of the GDP to 70% of GDP by 2020.\r\nWe expect to maintain the budget deficit below 3.5% by then. We will strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act affirming our commitment towards fiscal consolidation.\r\nIn the midst of all these, we have many other challenges in 2018 and 2019 in terms of public debt management and fiscal consolidation.\r\nThe domestic debt portfolio mainly consists of Treasury Bonds. Around 30% of the Treasury Bonds will mature by 2019. Similarly, Sri Lanka Development Bonds, which is a USD denominated domestic debt instrument, worth of over USD 2.3 billion will mature by 2018.\r\nIn addition, the composition of the foreign debt portfolio was also changed considerably.\r\nThis change was occurred mainly due to the increase of mobilizing commercial loans such as the issuance of International Sovereign Bonds. We have to pay USD 1.5 billion in 2019 for maturities of International Sovereign Bonds. Further, we have to pay annually thereafter.\r\nWhen considering the public debt service payments based on the outstanding debt as at end of August 2017, we have to pay Rs. 1,974 billion in 2018. We will have to pay Rs. 1,515 billion in 2019. It means we have to pay more than 3,489 billion in 2018 and 2019 for debt servicing.\r\nIn order to overcome these unprecedented challenges, the government has initiated a prudent debt management strategy. Our traditional approaches to debt management will have to change to cope with new risks and structural and regulatory changes.\r\nOur policies will be targeted on forward-looking liability management strategies.\r\nAccordingly, the funds required by the government will be raised with transparency and predictability. Under the medium-term debt management strategy, the detailed strategies of government borrowings will be known in advance to the domestic and foreign debt portfolios.\r\nIn addition, we will introduce a comprehensive secondary market trading platform and a liability management fund. These reforms and future reforms will come into effect under the new Fiscal Liability Management Act that provides a legal framework for a prudent debt management strategy.\r\nThe changes we have made by introducing the new Inland Revenue Act have been commended by the international community as well as domestic economic actors.\r\nWith the reforms such as the new Inland Revenue Act, Foreign Exchange Act, Fiscal Liability\r\nManagement Act, Corporate Intents of the State Owned Enterprises and close monetary-fiscal coordination, we will steer this country towards the robust and judicious management of our financial resources and fiscal framework.\r\nMaintaining Low Inflation\r\nOur government is taking a two-pronged approach to address the price stability.\r\nWe expect to provide the opportunity of buying the food items at a lower price throughout the year in order to control the short-term price fluctuations resulting in hardships to the people.\r\nWe will improve the domestic supply chains and distribution networks to do so. In the meantime, we will allow importing of food products and other essential commodities at reasonable costs within the competitive market framework.\r\nWe have reduced taxes on food commodities substantially over the past three months. We urge domestic wholesalers and retailers to pass the benefit of these reductions to the consumers.\r\nHowever, the government will provide the space to the Central Bank to carry out its monetary policy independently to maintain price stability on a sustainable basis. The Central Bank is moving towards a new monetary policy framework targeting a flexible inflation.\r\nThe aim of this framework is to maintain a low inflation continuously while supporting the economic activities. With this change of policy, our people will get the opportunity to live comfortably with the security of stable prices.\r\nDevelopment Vision 2025\r\nAs we emphasized in the Vision 2025 document launched in September, we want to transform Sri Lanka into the hub of the Indian Ocean, safeguarded by a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy. Our ambition is to make Sri Lanka a prosperous country by 2025.\r\nFor this vision to become a reality, our activities should join hands with the external world.\r\nSri Lanka is a small island right in the middle of a large world. For thousands of years, we have benefitted from being located strategically. Unfortunately, we seem to have forgotten this competitive advantage of the location.Our vision is to reclaim that mantle of international connectivity. In here, we have to leave behind the decades of inward-looking policies that shrouded our capacity to grow.\r\nFor this vision to become a reality, we must encourage the entrepreneurs to diversify our exports. From that, our export basket will be improved with diversity. For decades, we have relied on the same exports products such as garments, rubber, and tea.\r\nThese have been the giants of our exports economy. But now, we should diversify our exports by adding value-added goods and services.\r\nAnd also, we should integrate into the producer-driven value chains. If we enable our domestic businesses especially small and medium enterprises to create linkages with the international value chains, we will be able to see immense leaps in productivity and profits.\r\nFurther, we must provide the opportunity for the private sector to drive growth and investments. We have relied on the public sector for too long ignoring the private sector.\r\nWe have scared away private investments with unclear policies and complicated procedures for too long. The effort of our government is to create an economy firmly based on foreign and domestic private investment, driven by a dynamic and forward-looking private sector.\r\nA 3-Year Economic Delivery Programme\r\nTo kick-start this transformation, we will implement a comprehensive economic strategy over the next three years.\r\nWe intend to raise per capita income to USD 5000 per year.\r\nWe hope to create one million new jobs.\r\nOur target is to increase foreign direct investment to USD 5 billion per year.\r\nWe plan to double the exports to USD 20 billion per year.\r\nEnriched and Empowered People\r\nThe goal of these development strategies is improving the lives of the average Sri Lankans.\r\nThus we will strive for two basic economic outcomes:\r\nIncreasing and improving jobs.\r\nRaising incomes and expanding the middle class.\r\nFor this, our crucial need is to enhance education and skill development to enable all citizens to contribute to a knowledge-based economy.\r\nThe unemployment rate among the youth, those who have passed GCE A/L, and females, estimated at 18.5%, 39.9%, and 6.5%, respectively. This illustrates the current structural deficiencies in the domestic labour market and the issue of skills mismatch.\r\nRecognizing these shortcomings, the government will be initiating a number of basic educational reforms. We will guarantee 13 – years of education for everyone. After the\r\nGCE Ordinary Level examination, students will be directed to higher education, vocational education, jobs, and training.\r\nFurthermore, Information and Communication Technology, which is a need of the hour will be included in the school curriculum and the intake to universities in such disciplines will be increased.\r\nThis also aligns with government’s broader objectives and effort towards a digitally empowered economy. This approach will provide the opportunity for the youth to engage in better jobs while getting their skills developed.\r\nThe Government will encourage the private sector to develop the skills of the market by investing on skills development and joining hands with the public-private sector initiatives.\r\nRecent estimates show that 23% of the population will be elderly by 2042. With the rapid increase of the aged population, skill development programs will also target older workers.\r\nAnd also, action will be taken to tackle the drop in productivity due to outdated skills. The government is planning to formulate policies to have a balance between the needs of foreign employment and domestic labour market.\r\nAs the first step, labour shortages in the market will be filled. Foreign employment will be promoted only when the earnings are high and, only when the earning opportunities are available for skilled workers.\r\nWith better working conditions such as improved public transport and flexible working conditions, there is a chance that Sri Lankans living abroad will actively contribute to the country’s growth process. We can expect their engagement for the development of our country and overall improvement in working conditions.\r\nCurrently, 60% of the employed population is engaged in informal and illegal economic activities. 40% of the employed population is engaged in vulnerable categories of jobs. We will take steps to uplift the standards of all jobs and to secure the social recognition and safety by providing internationally accepted certifications and licenses.\r\nThis will result in minimizing the informal nature of the jobs. A contributory pension scheme will be introduced for those who are employed in the informal sector. This will result in minimizing the likelihood of poverty after retirement.\r\nTrade and Tariff Reforms for the Growth of Export Targets\r\nWe were a trading nation since the era of ancient kings. Sri Lanka was the hub for transferring goods and knowledge from East to West, and West to East. We should learn from the history of exports and private sector growth which are key elements for becoming a higher middle-income economy. People living in developed and developing East Asian and South East Asian countries such as China and Thailand have better jobs and higher living standards than the average Sri Lankans. I remember travelling to villages in these countries in 1979. They did not have many comforts or western foods enjoyed by Sri Lankans by then.\r\nBut today, the situation is different. How Sri Lanka lost its pace of development while other countries were progressing? This is a question that we should ask ourselves. They embraced open economic policies focused on exports. Meanwhile, we looked inwards and adopted closed policies. Therefore we missed 30 years of valuable opportunities.\r\nAs I said before, Sri Lanka’s exports are still based on traditional plantation crops together with apparels and tourism. We still compete for apparel with lower income economies resulting in pressure to keep our wages low. Still, our biggest foreign exchange earner is foreign employment sector. Yet all these foreign exchange earnings are insufficient to meet our import bills.\r\nThis lack of export growth contributes to the pressure on the balance of payments. This results in the depreciation of the rupee and affects the prices of goods.\r\nOn the other hand, other middle-income countries such as Thailand and Vietnam are exporting a more diversified range of high-value products such as automobile parts, machinery, and electronics. They are leaving us behind. We will have to catch up to our competitors.\r\nWe have to change all these things if we are to strengthen the economy and to create more jobs.\r\nWe have obtained good results from the steps we have taken to stabilize the economy.\r\nTherefore, we should now focus on adopting export-led economic growth strategies and policies by providing high-value and diversified products and services.\r\nA key part of this policy will be entering into Free Trade Agreements with partner countries around the world. We are making great progress towards mutually beneficial Free Trade\r\nAgreements with Singapore, China, and India. These deals will give our economy a massive boost by opening huge new markets to our entrepreneurs.\r\nWe must ensure that both local manufacturers and export manufacturers are competitive through this export-led strategy. Businesses may have to restructure focusing on which aspects make them competitive. Only then Sri Lanka will become a highly competitive economy.\r\nTo ensure a smooth transition for these companies, the government will be formulating a trade adjustment package. We have already taken steps in that regard, enacting the Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act, and moving forward with the Anti-Dumping Bill.We are also formulating a new National Export Strategy and a new National Trade Policy. The government is also establishing a National Single Window for Trade facilitation, and creating a new development bank for development financing with an export-import window.\r\nStrengthening our Capacity for Growth\r\nFor our export-led economic strategy to be a success, we must target and obtain much more Foreign Direct Investment and Local Private Direct Investment in high-value products.\r\nForeign Direct Investments have been the engine of growth for East Asia and South East Asia, and Sri Lanka can certainly attract similar or higher levels of investments.\r\nFor this, it is essential that we improve the investment climate. We should push Sri Lanka to top positions in relevant global indicators.\r\nWe will simplify the hurdles that investors currently face in dealing with a large number of government agencies. The reform agenda and an organizational setup focusing on implementation and continuous review of progress are already in place.\r\nWe launched the eight-fold action plan on Investment Climate Reforms in July 2017. It was developed following in-depth key stakeholder consultations to understand the obstacles faced by business owners and investors. This engaging and transparent approach is the key to success of the reforms. We will contribute to raising Sri Lanka’s Ease of Doing Business ranking from 110 in 2017 to 70 by 2020.\r\nAdditionally, the steps are being taken to establish a Single Window for new business registration that brings more than 20 Government agencies together.\r\nComprehensive Industrial Strategies\r\nMoreover, we will implement a comprehensive industrialization strategy that connects manufacturing with other sectors. Since economic liberalization in 1978, our progress in human development aspects have been on par with advanced economies. Yet our industries have declined.\r\nThe contribution of industrial activities and the manufacturing sector to economic growth has remained stagnant during the last two decades. Industrial activities contributed 27.6% of GDP in 2000 and only 29.7% in 2016.\r\nInability to remain competitive, lack of value addition and lack of sophisticated technology are the main reasons for this situation. We will revitalize the manufacturing sector by introducing a clearly defined industrialization strategy.\r\nPromotion of Tourism\r\nIn 2016, we have attracted more than 2 million international visitors generating an estimated revenue of USD 3.5 billion. The industry provided 320,000 local jobs in 2015.\r\nIn the coming years, we will strengthen the tourism sector so that we can work towards our goal of attracting five million tourists to Sri Lanka every year.\r\nMassive resort hotels dominated our tourism sector in the past. But current research shows that 90% of Sri Lanka’s hotels have less than 10 rooms. This is an Airbnb economy. This is an economy where every individual with a spare room has the capacity to earn cash. We will streamline the informal sector and ensure the quality and standards.\r\nTourists are not just coming to Sri Lanka for the standard hotel holiday. Therefore, the government will take steps to develop tourist attractions. Sri Lanka will be made a destination where tourists should come for unique experiences. Travellers have focussed on a number of sectors such as our culture, cuisine, traditions, wildlife, Ayurveda, and meditation.\r\nThe contribution of all stakeholders in the public and private sectors is required to boost the tourist attraction. 4-year tourism development strategy which was prepared to consult all relevant stakeholders will provide the base to achieve the tourism vision 2025.\r\nChina and India are our biggest and most rapidly expanding markets. We must shift our tourism strategies accordingly. We have to expand our connections with the countries from which the well-spending tourists are coming.\r\nWe have to liberalize access to sea and air services. Therefore action will be taken to develop air access domestically and internationally while facilitating cruise services and the establishment of yacht marinas.\r\nImproving Opportunities for Housing\r\nWith all our focus on growth, we have certainly not forgotten the fundamental needs of our people. Our goal is to provide shelter for all in 2025.\r\nThe government is drafting a new national housing policy built on three key features. First, the policy is a people-centric policy. People will engage in decision-making, actions, and responsibilities. Secondly, we are going to pursue integrated and inclusive urban housing development. Thirdly, we will ensure that housing development is sustainable.\r\nWe have allocated Rs. 75 billion to the National Savings Bank to provide housing loans at concessionary rates, and we have allocated Rs. 75 billion for the urban regeneration programme and other housing programmes.\r\nThe Government will not act as the sole owner. The Government will act as a delegated authority. The government will play the central role in setting the framework for housing development, but a lesser role in providing investment. We will enable the people and private sector to take control of investing on housing.Market-driven Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)\r\nWe recognize the need for sustainable investments in socio-economic infrastructure such as education, health, electricity, roads, and highways. It will contribute to Sri Lanka’s rapid transition into a middle-income country. Our aim is to utilize PPP to gap these investment opportunities.\r\nAccordingly, the government will formulate a clear PPP policy with a well-defined legal, regulatory and institutional framework to attract private players with the requisite capacities. Potential areas for expanding PPP include healthcare, leisure, tourism, education, ports and aviation, transportation, highways, information, and communication technology, and energy.\r\nWe will prioritize expanding opportunities for alternate financing to support PPP programmes.\r\nStrengthening Public-Private Partnerships in the Agriculture sector\r\nWe hope to harness the power and energy of PPPs to improve efficiency and productivity of agriculture. The agriculture sector is saddled with major issues such as low productivity, lack of diversification, inefficiency in water management, and poor management of weather disruptions.\r\nWeaknesses in the sector contribute to food insecurity and regional poverty. We will revitalize this sector through investments in agricultural research, extension services, water resources, and infrastructure facilities. We will facilitate the shift from traditional low value to modern high-value agriculture.\r\nWe will encourage scientific farming, promote agro-based industries and initiate commercial agriculture with the participation of farmer organizations and the private sector.\r\nWe will encourage the small and medium scale agri-businesses to invest in commercial agriculture and value chains through the agriculture modernization project. Further, we hope to see the modernization in the plantation sector.\r\nThe government will also promote information and technology-enabled agricultural extension services to farmers by encouraging mobile phone-based services. This will turn the farmers who are depending on the on subsidies into agri-businessmen. Supporting SMEs through Swashakthi\r\nAnother key feature of our support for the small businessman is the Swashakthi loan scheme. The government launched Swashakthi with the intention of supporting small and medium scale entrepreneurs to start self-employment projects and industries to strengthen the village economy.\r\nWe have seen high demand for this scheme. That means we have deep wells of entrepreneurial capacity just waiting to be tapped. We will extend this scheme further to support the entrepreneurial skills and ideas of the youth. We are in the process of launching several new schemes to support technology-based SMEs.\r\nIn order to improve the efficiency of government loan schemes and refinance schemes, we will also continue efforts to consolidate such schemes. We urge financial institutions to keep intermediation costs low so that the whole country can benefit from reasonable interest rates on loans.\r\nEmpowering Women\r\nWe aim to create an environment where all citizens have the opportunity to achieve higher incomes and better standards of living. Therefore one of our main priorities is creating safe working conditions for women.\r\nWomen participation in the labour market remains low in Sri Lanka compared with a majority of advanced and emerging market economies and the region. The present Women Labour Force Participation Rate is less than half of that of males, lingering around 30%-35% since 1990s. This participation is not enough to sustain the high growth momentum of the economy.\r\nWe should improve the public transport systems enabling women to travel comfortably to their workplaces. We are introducing the Light Rail Transit (LRT) with this purpose. This will greatly ease the current passenger congestion and provide a convenient and a safe mode of transport.\r\nFurthermore, the National Child Day Care Centre Guidelines as already approved by the Cabinet will assist in creating more affordable and transparent childcare centers across the island. People will have the opportunity of obtaining their services at a reasonable rate.\r\nArchaic labour laws which restrict females from effectively participating in the labour force, contribute to lower participation and lower productivity levels. Therefore, the government is committed to introducing new legislation.\r\nThe present situation in the private sector on maternity benefits and access to tertiary and vocational education facilities will be improved. We will encourage and strengthen the Small and Medium Enterprises. Women can play a major role in these enterprises.\r\nBuilding a Stronger Economy\r\nA number of projects which accelerate our journey towards a stronger economy are being implemented. We are building a well-planned expressway system from Hambanthota to Kandy. We have obtained funds for that.\r\nWe started a joint venture in Hambanthota Port this year. Discussions are being held to start a joint venture in Mattala Airport as well. We have started working on Hambanthota economic zone. Millaniya Trade Zone has been planned already. Wayamba Industrial Zone has also been planned. The constructions of those zones will commence next year.The construction of the first stage of the port city which will be developed as a Financial City is nearing completion. We will develop the Kandy City by joining hands with the Japanese government. India and Japan are extending their assistance to construct LNG plants.\r\nTourism Zones in the Southern have been planned. Acquisition of lands is taking place now. We will start working on tourism zones in Iranawila and the Eastern Province soon.\r\nThe Budget 2018 which will accelerate these programmes will be presented in Parliament next month. The Budget will provide the opportunity to extend the development which was limited to the Western Province, to all over including Southern, North-Western and Central Provinces.\r\nThose who can develop with skills and effort will be encouraged by the Budget. Others will also be supported.\r\nThis is a very challenging journey towards prosperity. This is a plan to enrich the country by 2025. This is an effort to make Sri Lanka again, the economy and trade hub of the Indian\r\nOcean. I urge all of you to join hands with me in this challenging journey towards prospering our motherland.\r\n"

There are many problems in my country. “We have, in recent months, taken many important steps for socio-economic transformation. Before I came to power, people in my country were living in fear and I ended that period and made the people free of fear, established rule of law and restored democratic rights.“My intention is to make people of Sri Lanka one of the happiest among the world communities by establishing a knowledge-based society. I am determined to alleviate poverty in my country. For that purpose I have declared 2017 as the Year of Alleviation of Poverty.“In order to improve the living standards of our people, we have to provide better facilities for economic development. I have given the topmost priority to take my country forward by working in cooperation with the United Nations and its agencies and other institutions. We have to make necessary changes to achieve sustainable development. The priority areas of the government include establishment of a knowledge-based economy with new initiatives and creation of a green economy.“As an Island-Nation, Sri Lanka wishes to make maximum utility of sea resources, fisheries and marine resources. All these require new technology and we seek the support of the international community for these purposes. Sri Lanka is a country with free education and free health services and the country has all the basic infrastructure requirements for speedy development.“The world today is full of hate, violence and fear. We must free our people from such hatred and fear and establish a society with moral values. The government is totally committed to reconciliation process to establish lasting peace. That would definitely prevent occurrence of another war in our country. Terrorism lasting three decades has ended and now we have undertaken the process of reconciliation among the different communities. We require the support of the international community to successfully face these challenges.“Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced. There are solutions in Buddhist teachings to most of the problems faced by the people in this world. Similarly, those who follow other religions like Hinduism, Islam and Christianity too can find answers to these problems by these great religious philosophies.“I am totally committed to eradicate drugs. As the President of Brazil said this morning, illicit drugs have become the most serious challenge faced by our societies today. Unless we take early steps to stop the menace of drugs we will be faced with a catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude. The harm caused to the people, especially the young students by illicit drugs is very serious. We have to eradicate drugs and ensure that illicit drugs would not reach our countries.“We have taken effective steps to strengthen democracy, rule of law and good governance in our country. We want to create a better country for our people. To achieve these, I need the assistance of the international community.“Different countries have their own unique authentic thinking. We too have such authentic thinking and visions. I want to create a country, in which our people can live as better humans and I need your support for this endeavor.“I wish to take this opportunity to express appreciation about the services rendered by the outgoing UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. He provided and excellent service to the entire world.“I would like to mention that my desire is to arm the new generation with knowledge and modern technology. I will do my duties and fulfill my responsibilities towards my people and I seek your assistance and blessings of you all for this task.”"

                    "content": "Living in a one-bedroom former camping ground cabin in Queenstown are three brothers, their mother, and father.\r\n \r\nThere's not much space but the family's priorities are clear. On the walls are maps and mathematics charts. Desks and chairs cluttered with books and papers sit in a line under the window. Cricket bats and guitars are piled in between.\r\n \r\nThe Wijerathne boys – aged 11, 10 and 8 – attend Queenstown Primary School, where they are regarded as excellent students. Two made it to the recent finals of the Otago-Southland spelling bee. They were invited to sit Australian academic exams. They are swimmers and cricketers, playing for the Queenstown Club where dad Sam coaches. They go to church every Sunday.\r\n \r\nIt isn't an easy life. Their Sri Lanka-born parents have worked long hours as a chef and a taxi driver in one of the most expensive places in the country to support them and their mother has developed health issues. But it is better than the life they left behind eight years ago.\r\n \r\nHowever, that is set to change. The family has been told they have to leave New Zealand on November 21.\r\n \r\nThe boys' mother, Dinesha Amarasinghe, tells her story through the tears that flow through her day, every day since her latest application for a temporary working visa was declined.\r\n \r\nShe says the boys are angry with her. Her eldest son, Subath, wants to know why he can't join his friends at the new Wakatipu High School, which opens next year. Eight-year-old Senath wants to go to school camp. He was a year old when the family left Sri Lanka. New Zealand is his home.\r\n \r\n\"I blame myself all the time,\" Dinseha says. \"They're very good kids at sports and studies. We are not doing any wrong things. We are helping at the school . . . everywhere. My kids, they can't go back there [Sri Lanka].\"\r\n \r\nLooking for a better life for their children and with Sri Lanka undergoing civil war for 25 years, Dinesha applied to come to New Zealand as a hospitality student in 2010. She had 10 years of industry experience and started working as a cook in Auckland in 2011, under Immigration New Zealand's skilled migrant category.\r\n \r\nLate in 2011, the family moved to Queenstown, where she worked as a commis chef at the popular Lone Star restaurant. Based on Dinesha's visa, Sam was granted an open work permit and worked at New World supermarket, the Hilton and as a taxi driver.\r\n \r\nIn 2014, Dinseha slipped on the floor while working and was later diagnosed with a lumbar sprain. Despite the pain in her leg, she continued to work while awaiting treatment but in January 2015, continuing problems forced her onto ACC. In May 2015, she had a brain scan and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).\r\n \r\nIn October this year, because Dinesha was unable to work, her skilled worker temporary visa was declined. Without it, Sam can no longer work and the family has to leave the country by November 21.\r\n \r\nBATTLE WITH IMMIGRATION NZ \r\nThe family has an application for residency sitting with Immigration NZ. They applied in April 2013. Their lawyer, Shane Robinson, was not involved with their case then but says that for the application not to be resolved to date is unusual.\r\n \r\nImmigration NZ area manager Marcelle Foley said it usually took between six and 12 months to process a residency application. However, it was not unusual for longer processing times in complex cases \"as is the case in the situation\".\r\n \r\nThe processing of their residence visa has now been suspended as they have been unlawful in New Zealand since July, she said\r\n \r\nRobinson said a large part of the delay was because Sam overstayed a working visa in Japan in 2006 and was deported. Despite that, he was given a visa in New Zealand as a special direction in 2012 but a dispute over the facts was continuing and was unresolved. However, Dinesha's health has now taken over as the key issue.\r\n \r\nConfusing the family though is the fact that Dinesha was granted a new temporary work visa in 2016, despite her MS diagnosis. Robinson says Immigration NZ's operational instructions state MS disqualifies someone from getting a temporary work visa but Immigration NZ allowed it in this case partly because it was unclear what degree of her health issues was caused by the 2014 fall and there was the ability to grant a waiver in the case of a residence visa (which was still in progress).\r\n \r\n\"In hindsight, it may have been fairer on the family for INZ to decline the applications then and not give them false hope.\"\r\n \r\nFoley said the organization was aware in 2016 that Dinesha had MS. However, it was not until this year they became aware she had had a prolonged absence from work and she acknowledged that she would be unable to work in full-time employment for some time.\r\n \r\nDinesha was advised she was likely to impose significant costs or demands on New Zealand's health services or special education services, Foley said.\r\n \r\n\"All non-New Zealanders coming to New Zealand must have an acceptable standard of health so as not to impose undue costs or demands on New Zealand's public health system,\" Foley said.\r\n \r\nStill, when the family's application to renew the visa was declined in October, they were taken by surprise and plunged into the desperate situation they are now in. Dinesha cannot work to the extent that is required. Sam can work but was declined for a work visa-partner and doesn't fit the \"skilled employment\" category.\r\n \r\nRobinson said a request was being made for visas to be granted as a \"special case\" but the chances of that succeeding were low.\r\n \r\n\"We have also been instructed to file an appeal on humanitarian grounds . . . If both of those options fail, then the family's only hope is intervention by the minister of immigration.\"\r\n \r\nTHE FIGHT TO STAY\r\nThe family dreads the prospect of returning to Sri Lanka. Last year they visited for the first time since they have been in New Zealand. Subath, 11, has sad eyes and speaks quietly of the trip. \"I don't like to go back to Sri Lanka,\" he says. \"I don't like the mosquitos and we have don't have many friends there.\"\r\n \r\nHis parents are even more desperate to stay. \"I'm not thinking about my future as a rich man but I'm thinking about education for my children another few years. We are asking for a chance,\" Sam says.\r\n \r\nLife is hard in New Zealand but if they return to Sri Lanka they will have no money – it has all been spent on immigration and lawyers. Dinesha will not have access to the medicine she needs. Pay rates are low – not enough for Sam to support his children and wife – and the children, who are having great success at school now, will struggle with the native Sinhalese language and likely be finished school at 14 and become fodder for the gangs that are rampant in poorer communities.\r\n \r\n\"I'm not asking anyone for money. I've brought money from Sri Lanka to live here . . . now everything is gone but [in Sri Lanka] I have no house. I don't know where to start. Our parents are old, we can't ask them for help. They don't have money – we need to help them.\"\r\n \r\nThey are proud people but with Sam no longer permitted to work and with rent to pay, the $2500-a-month cost of Dinesha's medication and mounting legal costs, they have become reliant on charities, friends and the kindness of others.\r\n \r\n\"I can manage everything if they give me a chance,\" says Sam. \"That's why we don't ask anyone for a hand. But with both not working it's really hard.\"\r\n \r\nDinesha questions why after years of working and paying taxes in New Zealand, the family should be treated this way.\r\n \r\n\"I came to New Zealand along with my family holding heaps of hopes and ambitions.\"\r\n \r\nCOMMUNITY SUPPORT\r\nReassuringly for the family, they have already had massive support from their community.\r\n \r\nRobinson says he has received numerous letters and phone calls from people who want to support them. People such as the Salvation Army, Queenstown Primary School and Queenstown Cricket Club president Daniel Gibbons, who writes of the time Sam has given as a coach and player at the club over the seven years they have been involved: \"It would be a great loss to our club and community to lose such a family, so we implore you to reconsider their case.\"\r\n \r\nBaskets of Blessing co-ordinator Tam Schurmann has picked up the family's cause and started a Givealittle page in the hope of providing some of the continuing support they need.\r\n \r\n\"I feel that their treatment now is not humane treatment of a family.\"\r\n \r\nThey are not the kind of people who ask for help, she says.\r\n \r\n\"They have been managing on their own. It was doctor's orders for her to stop work. I think the reason the MS has been so bad recently is that she's so stressed.\"\r\n \r\nImmigration NZ had \"kicked them in the teeth\", she said.\r\n \r\nQueenstown Primary School principal Fiona Cavanagh says the school is also doing what it can to support the family, including lobbying on their behalf.\r\n \r\n\"Those boys come to school to learn. They put in the effort and should be able to reap the benefits . . . Ultimately, we will have to follow the rules but in this instance, there's a humanitarian aspect that needs to be seriously considered.\"\r\n \r\n - Stuff"

                    "content": "According to medical reports an environment which is conducive for infections is not suitable for him.Life threatening conditions may surface at unanticipated moments. R. Duminda Silva had his whole life overturned due to an accident which was highly underrated by society, and was associated with many misconceptions.According to all medical reports the young politician experienced a fatal incident which resulted in brain damage.However, some do not believe this.The result of the 2011, Bharatha- Duminda clash caused a ripple effect in society.He was charged for the murder of Bharatha and was sentenced to death last year.Duminda Silva spends his time in the prison hospital with an extremely sensitive disability.Duminda Silva’s father Lal Silva expressed his views to the Divaina – Irida Sangrahaya Question :-  There are many stories going around regarding the current health conditions of Duminda. Is he really facing life threatening conditions?Answer - Duminda was with other inmates for about 20 days, and was admitted to the prison hospital upon the worsening of a virus fever. Following this his health conditions began to deteriorate further. Singaporean doctor Kithgo, who performed a brain surgery on Duminda in his report provided to us in 2013 noted that an environment which is conducive for bacterial infections is unsuitable for him.  The report notes that his real health conditions cannot be ascertained through his physical appearance and that his health can worsen without warning.According to medical expert’s opinion, it is a miracle that he lives. During the Cranioplasty surgery which was performed in Singapore the missing part of the skull was embedded with a 30 mm piece of an artificial skull. Following this two other surgeries were performed in Singapore. His health was previously restored through the frequent visits to Singapore when the symptoms he is currently experiencing showed where minor surgeries were performed.Upon a request made by magistrate G.A.R Artigala, a medical report prepared by a medical council comprising of 9 doctors signed by the Colombo National Hospital Deputy Director Anil Jasinghe was handed over to the courts on the 3rd of this month. The report highlighted the health issues and detrimental consequences which were likely to appear. It is clear that this medical report has confirmed the reports provided by the doctors from Singapore.  I sincerely hope that those who were slinging mud stating that these reports were false, are able to comprehend the real situation at least now.Due to this he is in need of a sterile environment for living along with a calm atmosphere for a composed state of mind due to his condition. If not, the conditions might be life threatening. It is not possible to predict a time and place for such an overturn. Such accidents have been explained in scholarly books.Question :- Are the responsible institutions informed of this special need?Answer -  Maheshi Wijeratne, the doctor who was active with regard to the case of Duminda, had sent him for a medical examination to the Jayewardenepura hospital. The director board had not permitted the treatment of inmates at the hospital and had sent the ambulance back to the prison hospital without letting him even step out of the ambulance. Therefore a letter was addressed to the Prime Minister requesting permission to be directed to a private hospital and back to his doctor. But the Minister in charge of prisons responded stating that due to the nature of the punishment, further treatment cannot be provided.Question :- Did you file an appeal against the death sentence?Answer -  Yes, that was to the Supreme Courts. There was a division between the judges regarding the decision. The decision was given from two extremes. As a representative of the older generations, I have placed my trust on the judiciary. I strongly believe that the courts will provide relief by investigating into the matter comprehensively. An appeal has been filed with the Supreme Court bringing to light, the logical, theoretical, conceptual, legal, analytical errors as well as how core theories have not been followed when interpreting the law.Even though I can explain this in detail, as this is discussed in the judiciary and as I have great respect towards the courts, I wish to refrain from expressing my views regarding this matter any further.Question :- It could be seen that there is great criticism about the media reports published regarding Duminda.Answer - I believe that the certain individuals exploit new media, media traditions and technology to benefit them. The manner in which some of these websites, and social media are active is extremely harmful. For instance, they falsify the public opinion artificially. They create a façade which is unreal.  This is dangerous. The civil society can collapse if such a situation progresses. Those who misuse this are those who must be cornered in society as such acts encompass lies, deceit, jealousy as they don’t even have a proper identity and are capable of even altering their appearance.Insulting and influencing the courts by dashing coconuts or through media portrayals should not be permitted.  Question :- Explain a bit about your family background.Answer - My grandfather, A. Victor Silva lived in Kalutara, Kalamulla. He was popularly known as Victori Mudalai. This was since the beginning of 1900. He owned large acres of land in rubber, coconut and cinnamon.  The older brother of my father is A.V. P Silva who was a doctor.  In 1935, he had to serve in Hambantota during the outbreak of tuberculosis. His siblings urged him to engage in a private clinic, but as he had taken a pledge to serve patients he declined. He passed away at the age of 33 in 1939.  Another sibling is Francis Silva who was a renowned lawyer. His other brother, Nobet Silva was the Chairman of the Kalutara U.C.  My father Alfoncess was an estate director and later held the D.L.O appointment.  (D.L.O was a higher appointment to D.R.O).  All of them schooled at the St. Benedicts College in Kotahena and were accommodated at the school hostel.My father schooled at St. Sebastians College. My mother’s 5 siblings, (1950 onwards) I and my brothers (1960 onwards) schooled at St. Benedicts and were accommodated by the school hostel. My mother’s father A. Anasley Silva was the owner of about 20 hours along the Ratmalana Reeta road. Former minister of trade, Kingsley Wickramaratne was a brother of my grandfather. My father in law is Looshan Harry Ukawatte Liyanage. He studied at S. Thomas’s College Mount Lavinia and served in Sri Lanka Army, during World War II in Singapore.My wife’s father had donated all his properties to the temple and to the Rahula College. He is the most venerable late Athadisi thero of the Galle Manthinda Pirivena temple.Her grandmother is Charlotte Alexander Pinto Jayawardena Alwis. Her brother’s children were, Lin De Alwis- the director general of wild life conservation, Former Warden of S. Thomas’s College Neville De Alwais and Former IGP wife, Lakshmi Kodithuwakku and a prominent member of the Lanka Sama Samaja party OC De Alwis. I don’t like to speak of this but as a reply to all the criticisms it is necessary that I mention we had the ability and wealth for generations and this is the reply to the question you raised. I received the wealth of my parents and their families.I am A.V.P Silva. I am FCA and FMAAAT qualified.  Most know me as Lal Silva. I am a commissioned auditor by profession. I’m serving as a managing director of four reputed companies and as the director of 5 other companies. During my youth I was part of the victorious Havelock sports club where I played rugby for about 5 years since 1968. I provided extensive service as the treasurer of the Sri Lanka Rugby Association and was the chairman of the Havelock sports club. I was able to uplift the institution to greater heights this quarter unlike ever before, financially and was able to credit a large amount into the account of the institution. I was able to develop institutions incurring losses and transform them into profit gaining organizations.  The income tax department provided a priority card for those who pay income tax legally for a prolonged period to obtain priority services from government institutions.  I received a gold card. Any individual who provides a good report to the bank and is able to manage their finances efficiently can be a wealthy person. Education alone, without practical knowledge cannot help the accumulation of wealth. They only know to interpret what is in the books.My wife is, Romaine Malkanthi Silva. My eldest son, Rayynor Silva is the owner of the largest media organization in the country.  There are number businesses my family owns. My other son, Vincent Silva represents one of the most profitable companies in the garment industry which brings the highest foreign income into the country. My oldest daughter, Dilini Silva is a multiple degree holder. (BSc HON IT, MBA, CIM UK, Doctorate Business Management CIM Sri Lanka prize winner). She is currently in her final year of the LLB law degree.  My youngest daughter Nilakshi Silva has a diploma in psychology. She is married to Dr. Gehan de Zoysa (BSc. Hons MBA, OHD MST Cambridge).  He owns a garment factory which is known as Velona. His grandfather who studied at S.Thomas’s College is former MP Raskin Fernando who was the proprietor of Velona.  His grandfather from his father’s side is the renowned Sir Henry Charles De Soysa who had gifted the De Soysa hospital for women, Eye hospital,  Hospitals of Lunawa, Marawila and Panadura, the Moratuwa stadium and the Prince of Wales Colleges.Question :-  How did your younger son enter politics?Answer -  As he was helping out youth sports teams in Peradeniya, through their ideas and influence he entered politics.  When he contested for Provincial council elections initially, I showed my disapproval. When I got to know his keenness towards helping people and being around people, I supported him. Since his young days, it was a habit of his to give to the poor in whatever way he could. He participated in sports when he was in St. Peters College.  He also held positions in executive level positions after learning the art of tea tasting and brokering. Later on he carried on a successful food business which was known as Lakshmi Food Center. I witnessed certain individuals speaking of this in an inferior manner. My family and the people, supported Duminda to the best of our ability. In the 2010 election, he came second, only to Wimal Weerawansa from Colombo.It was a habit of Duminda to help those who were helpless. He continued that practice even before he entered politics. He continued this further as a MP of the UNP provincial council.  Those who engaged in politics to achieve their narrow aims were jealous of him and made up stories accusing him of smuggling. It is clear that politicians greedy for votes created such fabrications to dismantle his process of helping the innocent and poor people, by manipulating the media.Through such unsubstantial allegations, the sincere action taken by him to help the poor was degraded. They accused Duminda without any proof. These were directed at him, so that the real culprits could continue their smuggling racket and mislead the legal authorities.Question :- Did politics mainly affect the unfortunate accident he was faced with?Answer - Yes, it was a Saturday and I was having an evening nap. I received a sudden call saying Duminda was shot, and immediately the line was cut. I received a call from my older son and was asked to go to the Jayewardenepura hospital. He was subjected to an immediate surgery. He was not in the right state of mind for about three weeks after. His left side was incapacitated.  I believe that Duminda had to go through all of this due to political jealousy. He progressed ahead of many traditional politicians and gained popularity in a short span of time. He achieved this position by helping people out to the best of his capacity.(This piece was formulated from an article published in Divaina – Irida Sangrahaya)      "

                    "content": "Life threatening conditions may surface at unanticipated moments. Duminda Silva, the former MP sentenced to death over the Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra murder, remains in the prison hospital with on-and-off repercussions of the serious injuries he suffered in the Kolonnawa shootout which cost two lives and injured several more. Here his father, Lal Silva, discusses his son’s plight.Q:- What is Duminda’s present condition? There are stories that his health is a matter of great concern.A:- Duminda who was held in jail with the other prisoners for nearly 20 days suffered from high fever due to a viral infection and was transferred to the Prison Hospital. Since then his health has been deteriorating and there have been repercussions from the penetrative brain injuries he suffered. His condition fluctuates from good, bad and worse quite often, as never before experienced after his return from hospital in Singapore.Duminda was critically injured due to gunshot injuries he received on his head on October 8, 2011. He suffered penetrative brain injuries in consequence, with bullets entering through the left side of the forehead and exiting through the right side of the skull, damaging a skull area of approximately 30cm x 30cm. He underwent surgery at Sri Jayawardenapura hospital performed by Specialist Neurosurgeon Dr. Mrs. Maheshi Wijeratne for right hemicraniectomy, wound debridement and removal of bullet fragments. However there are still metal fragments remaining in the deeper part of the right frontal lobe of the brain. He suffered loss of memory and weakness of the left upper limb especially the distal muscles affecting the left hand and leg.Due to the intensity of the injuries, memory loss and paralysis of the entire left side, we took him to Mt. Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore for treatment under Neuro Consultant Dr. Keith Goh and his team. Dr. Goh performed cranioplasty using CT scan customized prefabricated implant to repair the right skull hemicranectomy defect and also borehole surgeries to drain out fluid collection and also relieve brain pressure.He was subjected to intensive neurological rehabilitation in Singapore for nearly one and a half years including speech therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy etc. Irrespective of the doctors advising us to keep him there a little longer, we brought him back to Sri Lanka in March 2013 mainly to face the ongoing Court proceedings. The consultant neurosurgeon and rehabilitation consultant who attended on him in Singapore, very specifically cautioned us that he should avoid trauma and stressful situations and be away from unhygienic environments, as his health condition could reverse for the worse culminating even in life threatening situations.I must emphasize that Neuro Consultants have warned us that his physical appearance is not an indication of the brain trauma he suffered and absolute care must be taken. Patients of this kind with such penetrating head injuries may have unpredictable changes in their condition. Any adverse factors - trauma and impacts will not only reverse the progress he has made but is also life threatening (Shows the medical reports).As far as I know anxiety, psychological upheavals and fluctuation under different circumstances can cause health concerns. When, where and how it happens no one can predict. This is what Duminda is experiencing.On request made by Magistrate G.A.R. Attygalle to the JMO of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Duminda was subjected to X-ray, scanning and physical medical examinations by a panel consisting of nine specialist doctors who issued a medical report on March 3, 2017 under the signature of Deputy Director General of Health Services, National Hospital of Sri Lanka. This report confirmed the fluctuating health conditions experienced by Duminda due to the penetrative brain injuries he has suffered and confirmed the existence of bone fragments and metal bullet shrapnel embedded in the deep section of his brain. In other words they confirmed the earlier local and Singaporean medical reports.Q:- Did you inform the relevant authorities of this situation?A:- Yes. Due to critical repercussions, and the nature of his brain injuries, an attempt was made by the Prison Hospital authorities to seek treatment at Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital, referring to Dr. Wijeratne, but failed to receive the anticipated treatment facility as the authorities have said that the Board of Directors (of the Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital) has decided not to treat convicted prisoners there. If that be the case, I wonder whether Directors in Government related hospitals can take such board decision transgressing human rights.Thereafter, I took the liberty to write to the Prime Minister requesting him, in the best interest of my son’s health and life, that he be allowed to be referred to take treatment under Dr. Maheshi Wijeratne, even in a private hospital as his health condition and nature of his behavior under traumatic conditions in the past is well known to her. Further it will be advantages for patients with this type of brain injuries to feel comfortable in mind with their usual doctors in attendance.As a reply the Minister in charge of Prisons Reforms has stated that due to the nature of Duminda’s conviction, there is no possibility to extend such health services.Q:- You seem to be having problems about media propaganda on Duminda?A:- The advantages of technological enhancement in communication have been vilified and been misused by a section of society to quench their thirst for sadism and character assassination. This small organized cluster is a menace to society and a hindrance to genuine media.Thank God I have a professional background and the capacity not to be influenced by what is appearing in today’s social media. Those who are influenced or believe or act on these publications should not be holding responsible positions in the public or private sector as their gullibility will ultimately contribute to the deterioration of a decent civil society as so conspicuously seen today. Some do manipulate the social media to challenge or surreptitiously threaten the integrity of officials to falsely create various perceptions and instill a fear psychosis in the mindset of some officials preventing them from acting fairly. Duminda has been a victim of this vicious circle.Q:- Did you make an appeal to a higher court against the death sentence?A:- The High Court Trial at Bar bench was divided in their decisions with the two judgments at extremes - one handing down the death sentence while the other exonerated him from all charges laid against him.Our lawyers addressing the bench immediately after the delivery of the judgment, said they did not agree with its core. Lawyers have perused the judgment and summarized and highlighted instances where they expressed the opinion it had erred logically, principally, legally, factually and analytically. They have also expressed instances of deviations in norms in the interpretation of the law and sought redress via provision in law in an appeal to their Lordships of the Supreme Court detailing those instances in the text of our appeal which challenged the judgment in totality. I don’t want to say more as these are matters still to be deliberated in the Supreme Court for which I have the highest respect.Q:- Elaborate your family background?A:- My grandfather hails from the village Kalamulla in the Kalutara district. He was A. Victor Silva popularly known as \"Victory Mudalali\". He owned substantial extents of plantation land under coconut, rubber and cinnamon. I am taking about the very early part of 1900. My father’s eldest brother was Dr. A.V.P. SILVA and I was been named after him. During the period around 1935 when Hambantota district was plagued with the tuberculosis, he was transferred to Hambantota. Although his kith & kin pleaded with him to start his own private practice as they had enough wealth, he refused saying that he is under oath to treat patients whatever the circumstance may be. In 1939 he died at the age of 33-years. The other brother A. Francis Silva was a famous lawyer in the Kalutara/Matugama courts. He donated his large house on a two- acre property to a convent. The other brother A. Norbert Silva was the Chairman of the Kalutara UC.My father A. Alphonso Silva who was a planter at the early stages switched to government service and was a DLO at the time of his retirement. All the brothers had their education at St. Benedict’s College, Kotahena as boarders of the college (1920 era). My mother’s brothers (three) (1950 era), myself and my brother (1960 era) were also educated as boarders at St. Benedict’s College. While my father studied at St. Sebestian’s College, Moratuwa my mother’s other two brothers studied at St. Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya. My mother’s father, A. Ansalin Silva was from St. Rita’s Road, Ratmalana. He owned nearly 20 large houses. Late minister Kingsley T. Wickremaratne’s grandfather was his eldest brother. My wife’s father, Lucien Harry Ukwatte Liyanage, studied at St. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia and also served in the Army in Singapore during World War II. Her grandfather hailed from the Matara Ukwatte walauwa and his brother, a Buddhist priest, Reverend Athadisi Hamuduruwo, donated all his wealth to the Manthinda Temple in Galle and Rahula College. My wife’s grandmother Charlotte Alexandra Pinto Jayawardena De Alwis owned substantial wealth in Mt. Lavinia and was closely related to Sir Oliver Goonatilake. Her brothers’ children were late Mr. Lyn de Alwis, the renowned zoo and wildlife director, while another was former warden of St. Thomas’ College, Mr. Neville de Alwis; the others included the wife of former IGP Kodituwakku (late Mrs. Lakshmi Kodituwakku), and late Ossie de Alwis, a pioneer in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party.I dislike talking about all this but do so in the context that some disgruntled persons are trying to portray a dark picture to character assassinate our family by spreading malicious, baseless, politically motivated accusations and rumors and also in reply to your query. I reluctantly place these facts to enlighten any misguided persons and hope this will show that we hail from a reputed, educated, well to do generation with sufficient wealth.My father and mother who had their own accumulated wealth also inherited substantial wealth from their parents. I as the eldest son received a fair share of that wealth.My name is A.V.P. Silva (FCA/FMAAT) and is known amongst many as LAL SILVA. I am a Chartered Accountant by Profession and at present is the Managing Director of four companies and Director of five other companies including two large public quoted companies. During my school days I was an athlete, cricketer and a rugby player and later represented the Havelock’s rugby team for nearly five years since 1968. I served as the Honorary Treasurer of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union while I was also the President of the Havelock Sports Club. During my tenure of office in both these organizations I was able to use my expertise not only to improve their financial parameters as never done before and saved substantial amounts in fixed deposits.Further, I was able to turn around loss making organizations I earlier worked in to profit, a feat I am very proud of. In 2008 the Inland Revenue Department launched a privilege card to facilitate priority services from Government departments for those who paid substantial amount as income tax for a long period of time and I was entitled to the Gold Privilege Card. Some of those who slander people for their rise in life are not aware that with a good acceptable feasibility report, management expertise, dedication and commitment one can improve financially as the banks are always there to extend financial assistance for such projects. Of course this is not a possibility to those who are only educated literally but practically inefficient.My wife is Romayne Malkanthi Ukwatte Liyanage. My eldest son Rayynor Silva is the owner of a reputed Media Organization while my other son Vincent Silva is a Senior Officer directing operations in the Sri Lankan branch of a reputed International garment operation. Rayynor was a Peterite and represented the College in Cricket, Rugby and athletics. My daughter Dilini Silva ((BSc Hons. IT, MBA, CIM UK, Doctorate in Business Management) is now preparing for final LLB examination. My youngest daughter Nilakshi Silva (Diploma in Child Psychology) married to Dr. Gihan De Soyza (BSc Hons, MBA, OHD MST (Cambridge). He is the grandson of former MP Ruskin Fernando of Velona fame and the great grandson of Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, perhaps the country’s greatest philanthropist. My daughters were educated at Ladies College, Colombo 7, while my Son-in-law was at St. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia.Q:- How did your youngest son Duminda enter politics?A:- He was very popular with the young crowd and when he was engaged in his business of catering he extended financial support to promote sport activities and competitions. I believe it is on their insistence that he entered the political arena. At the inception when he contested the Provincial Council elections, I was not very supportive. But when I found his aim was to help the down trodden and the youth using political interfacing as a vehicle, I started to help him. The whole family rallied round him and was a source of strength in his role as a politician specially in helping the poor. He secured the highest preference votes in three elections and was second only to Mr. Wimal Weerawansa in the 2010 general election.From his small days he loved to help people. He was a sportsman at St. Peter’s College being an athletic champion and rugby coloursman. After A/Levels he joined Bartleet& Company for training in tea tasting and brokering. He then served as a senior manager in the tea department at Tea Packs (PVT) Ltd. He then engaged in his own business. He had two well patronized catering enterprises called Lakshmi Food Centre. I heard a person supposed to be of some stature lately undermining and ridiculing him for operating and working in his own catering business and audaciously inquiring how our family upgraded ourselves to be flourishing in business people. Displaying to the world his ignorance and viciousness, and publicly character assassinating with impunity does not augur well to the position he claims to hold.With our help Duminda did yeoman service helping the poor and was very popular among the people for his kind deeds. However, in an era where people were more interested in collecting money and building and accumulating wealth, Duminda set an example to those time serving politicians who helped voters only during the election time by being with the people all the time, extending a helping hand whenever possible using the good offices of an elected member to be of service at his own expense irrespective of whether it was election time or not.Few politicians contesting with him were jealous and envious and were hell bent to taint his character. They launched a smear campaign with the help of banned websites operating from abroad, address unknown. This was the only way they knew to disturb his progress. They started unsubstantiated fabrications to character assassinate him and manipulated the social media for political advantage. It was very evident that the malicious slandering was well planned without any evidence and was politically motivated. Everybody who stooped to those low levels and originated these falsehoods, knew very well that our family connected businesses were instrumental in helping him in his work. Along with politicians there were people engaging in nefarious illegal activities exploiting the opportunity to direct accusations at Duminda with the sole intention of not only diverting attention away from them but also to mislead the arm of the law. However, people who know Duminda were well aware that he was an innocent victim of vicious circle of selfish section of the society. If he was not a politician he would have been acclaimed as a philanthropist. No person indulging in illegal activities will ever help the poor publicly and lavishly and also seek wide publicity through electronic media.Q:- Is his present predicament a result of politics?A:- Political jealousy and greed for preference votes drove few with ulterior motives and unscrupulous political agendas to attack him in whatever way they could, stooping to the lowest level of character assassination.As revealed by most of the witnesses, since Duminda was shot first on the head at close range and as the perpetrators turned back and ran away once Dumi fell to the ground face upwards bleeding from his forehead, I wonder why one should not construe it as a failed assassination attempt on Duminda’s life.  An article published in Sunday Island.
