That is the very same reason why I dissolved the parliament when they submitted the motion of no confidence against PM Wickramasinghe to prevent Mahinda Rajapaksa from becoming Prime Minister by defeating Ranil Wickramasinghe.\"\"I will remain impartial in the coming election and request the people to vote for those who are suitable to march forward with the January 08 mandate.\"\"I am against giving nominations to former president Rajapakse, if at all if SLFP wins in the upcoming elections there are several deserving senior politicians to be the Prime Minsiter.\"\r\n"

The permission to carryout protective work on the site was granted following a request made by CCCC to the Sri Lankan Government.\r\nCCCC is appreciative of H.E. the President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, Hon. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe and the Cabinet of Ministers for granting permission to protect the reclaimed land area.   CCCC, a responsible Fortune 500 company having confidence in the future of Sri Lanka invested 1.4 billion USD to build the Colombo Port City. This is the single largest privately funded Foreign Direct Investment to date, in Sri Lanka.  \r\nAs a result of the project’s suspension, CCCC estimates an initial direct loss for the company of over USD 380,000 per day. Further the interest on the financial loan obtained by the company for the development of the project has to be paid, regardless of the ongoing suspension.\r\nThe company will continue to cooperate with the Sri Lankan Government on relevant evaluations of Colombo Port City.\r\nThe Colombo Port City project, which is a 100% privately funded FDI by CCCC, began construction following the signing of an Agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka on 16 September 2014.\r\n\r\n"

He noted that the formation of a National Government would create political and policy stability that would enable the country to address long-unsolved challenges facing Sri Lanka. Minister Samaraweera said that, just as Sri Lanka was a paradise for UAE tourists, the government’s objective was to make it a paradise for investors. He invited UAE firms, which are already a significant source of investment for Sri Lanka, to increase their investments, observing that the Government was establishing 45 economic development zones. Minister Samaraweera noted that the 250,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers employed the UAE make a tremendous contribution to Sri Lanka’s economy. He emphasized that Sri Lanka is committed to increasing the skill level of migrant workers entering the UAE – including domestic workers. He also noted that Sri Lanka would continue to engage through the Abu Dhabi Dialogue to improve inter-ministerial coordination and cooperation on migrant worker issues – including qualification recognition.The two Foreign Ministers also agreed to hold the second Sri Lanka-UAE Joint Commission later this year in Colombo.The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Employment, the Chairman of the Board of Investment and the Director-General to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and other senior officials attended the meeting. The UAE Foreign Minister also called on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

It is definitely not going to be smooth. I became the President, Mr Ranil Wickramasinghe became the PM and you all obtained ministerial posts, not to perform duties of an easygoing, relaxed sort. We all admit the toughness and the challenging nature of politics.\r\nOne could engage in serene politics with the acquisition of power. Yet immorality would emerge along with that serene political agenda. We must engage in challenging work, retaining the toughness. We do all that for the country and the public.   I’m obliged to you for agreeing to the SLFP and the UNP working together for a certain period of time. From the very beginning our path was not smooth. Some say that the PM and myself have been trapped in an Imperialist plot…I will not answer that yet. We shall respond through our work in the future, and prove that we truly love the country.\r\nWe will succumb to no foreign influence. We will not despoil the prestigious history of this country. Whether it be Buddhists, Christians Hindus or Muslims, all talk about the congregation and separation of people for the good of people.    The national government concept was introduced for the betterment of the country. Considering the combination of this government some say that it will not last long..  No one must expect a government before 2020. Whatever anyone might say, our government is the stable one. No one will be allowed to change it - I assert that point.  Our effort is to build the country with the combination of the two parties. We transformed the ignoble political culture that was in operation for the past few decades. Therefore we must all resolve with responsibility to perform our duties true to our conscience and abstain from all sorts of corruption.\r\nPM Ranil Wickramasinghe addressing the newly appointed State and Deputy Ministers: \r\nWe have got over the initial step of establishing the national government. The cabinet assembled and the initial discussion was held as well. This is a political revolution – two parties coordinating according to an agreement. The public expects the national government to provide solutions to the problems faced by them.  \r\nWe who are now gathered here in this manner, used to be constantly at tug-of-war divided into two factions. We must coordinate and proceed together. We must consider the ideas of both the TNA and the JVP. We have a new journey to make.\r\nThere were those who shirked their duties despite all the perks they enjoyed. This cannot happen anymore. The public handed over to us the responsibility of working for the country. Traveling abroad must be limited. We’ll get to work now.\r\nOur President was appointed on the 8th of January to initiate good governance. We have discussed together and covered up a large area of work. We shall solve our problems through discussions within our parties. Eventually we can be satisfied that we fulfilled our obligations for the country.\r\n\r\n19 State Ministers and 21 Deputy Ministers took oaths today\r\nAccordingly the total number of State and Deputy Ministers sworn in today is 40.\r\n\r\nThe three Deputy Ministers absent from the swearing-in ceremony:\r\nSiripala Gamlath - Deputy Minister - Foreign Employment\r\nAnuradha Lanka Jayaratne - Deputy Minister – Mahaweli Development and Environment\r\nSarathee Dushmantha - Deputy Minister - Justice\r\n\r\n19 State Ministers were sworn-in today\r\nSudarshani Fernandopulle - State Minister - Water Supply\r\nWasantha Senanayake - State Minister – Irrigation and Water Management\r\nWasantha Aluvihare - State Minister - Agriculture\r\nVasantha Senanayake - State Minister - Highways\r\nSujeewa Serasinghe - State Minister - International Trade\r\nWijekala Maheshwaran - State Minister - Child Affairs\r\nChampika Premadasa - State Minister - Industries\r\nMohan Lal Grero - State Minister - University education\r\nHisbullah - State Minister - Resettlement & Rehabilitation\r\nRuwan Wijewardane - State Minister – Defense\r\nNiroshan Perera - State Minister - National Policy Economy\r\nDilip Wedaarachi - State Minister - Fisheries & Water Resources\r\nPalitha Range Bandara - State Minister - Vocational Training\r\nV Radakrishnan - State Minister- Education\r\nRaveendra Samaraweera - State Minister - Labor\r\nLaxman Yapa - State Minister - Finance\r\nPriyankara Jayaratne - State Minister - Law & Order\r\nT.B.

The delegation visited the Northern Province on 1st November and met with the Governor and civil society representatives. They also visited an EU funded resettlement site and held discussions with some of those who have resettled. In Colombo, MEPs had the opportunity of meeting the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Development and International Trade and the Leader of the Opposition. They also met senior officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry for National Integration and Reconciliation. The delegation of the European Parliament welcomes a number of positive developments that have taken place since their last official visit, such as the decision to readmit Sri Lanka to its preferential trade program GSP+ and the lifting of the ban on Sri Lanka’s fisheries exports to the EU market. However, MEPs have underlined during their discussions that GSP+ was granted as an incentive for the reform process that the Government of Sri Lanka has embarked on. MEPs expressed concern that the progress achieved has been slower than originally hoped, but that the foundations for that progress were now mostly in place. The Chair encouraged the Government of Sri Lankan to pursue their deliberations on constitutional reform with a view to further strengthening the protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and, of course, the process of national reconciliation."

Chief Engineer of Aries-13, Jayantha Kalubowila said that the pirates reached their vessel in the guise of fishermen and later overpowered the vessel. The crew of the hijacked vessel told our news team yesterday that nearly 70 Somali pirates were on board. The crew also requested our news team to inform the Sri Lankan government to intervene in the matter and talk to Somali government and urge Somali authorities to remove their security cordon from the hijacked vessel as it could risk the lives of the Sri Lankan crew as well. Later, President Maithripala Sirisena directly intervened in the matter and ordered the Navy Commander to take necessary action with immediate effect. Accordingly, Joint Naval Brigade communicated with the Somali Marine Police and informed to stop firing at the hijacked vessel. Sri Lanka Foreign Ministry also mediated in the efforts to rescue the Sri Lankan crew from the clutches of pirates. Chief Engineer of the Vessel Jayantha Kalubowila express his gratitude to the parties including HIRU News staff for taking prompt action to save them from an imminent calamity."

While doing so, if a member or officer of the armed forces of the Sri Lankan government has committed offences, these investigations are aimed at finding out such instances. So if offences have been committed by an individual, we will clearly take legal action.\r\nIn detailing its principal findings, the OHCHR report stated: \"If established before a court of law, many of these allegations would amount, depending on the circumstances, to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity.\"\r\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, the Head-of-the-State has rejected the allegations.\r\nAccording to International Media, President Maithripala Sirisena has stated: \"I must say very clearly there are no allegations regarding 'war crimes', there were war crimes allegations during the early stages.

During the 2015 Presidential elections, Tamils overwhelmingly voted for Hon. Maithiripala Sriseana as he had promised that Tamil prisoners will be given general amnesty and released immediately after his swearing in.” Sirisena went back on the promise given by him and released only 31 prisoners on conditional bail.\r\nThe prisoners had refused to accept the conditional bail and gone back to the prison, he said, in a letter to Modi. “More than 200 prisoners are now on a fast-unto-death struggle inside the prisons.\r\nTamils have begun peaceful protests. On November 13 the entire Tamil-homeland consisting of the Northern and Eastern Provinces protested by observing a harthaal, responding to a call by all political parties of the Tamils including the TNA.\r\nAll shops were closed. Schools did not function. Buses did not run. By breaking their promises, Sinhalese are pushing the Tamils to a struggle-mode, largely non-violent,” Karunanidhi said. "

Anyone can be nominated, but only a number of people have the right to nominate, including members of national assemblies and governments, current and former members of the Committee, Peace Prize laureates, professors of certain disciplines, directors of peace research and foreign policy institutes, and members of international courts. As such, the Director of PRIO holds the right to nominate, but refrains, given his active role as a commentator. The laureate is normally announced on the Friday of the first full week of October. Harpviken's 2017 Nobel Peace Prize Shortlist ·        The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Susan N. Herman·        The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)·        Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka·        The White Helmets (Syrian Civil Defense) and Raed al Saleh·        Jeanne Nacatche Banyere, Jeannette Kahindo Bindu and Dr Denis Mukwege The reasons mentioned by the PRIO to nominate Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena: \"President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena has initiated a comprehensive set of reconciliatory initiatives to heal the wounds of the civil war which culminated in a military onslaught by the state military on the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in 2009. Sirisena’s insistence on inclusive reconciliation, therefore, stands out as an example to be followed, especially in a situation where support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other transitional justice mechanisms is deteriorating. In early 2017, the Sri Lankan Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms released its final report. This goes hand in hand with a range of other efforts, including a consultative process on constitutional reform. Resistance from the political opposition is real, and so are the prospects for failure. The President himself is susceptible to criticism, having held posts with the former government that overran the LTTE. A Nobel Peace Prize to President Sirisena would fit a tradition of honouring pragmatic leaders who show political courage, and it would draw attention to reconciliation as a key to sustainable peace\"."

He also said that certain television channels have been leased to publicize that the same number of seats are allocated under the new electoral system as well.He introduced such system as a march towards Constitutional authoritarian ship. Minister Hakeem also warned that the SLFP should beware of these dictatorial persons."

Responding immediately, President Maithripala Sirisena issued directives to the respective authorities to immediately investigate into the matter. The President furthermore ordered the authorities to broaden the borders of Wilpaththu National Park, including all the adjoining forest reserves and to gazette it. The President also instructed the authorities to appoint a special inspection team including journalists, to compile a report on the constant deforestation activities taking place in Mannar and Puttlam districts. Accordingly, a special inspection team from the Wildlife Conservation Department was dispatched to the area of concern yesterday. Hiru CIA and Venerable Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera of the Environmental Organizations Collective too joined the inspection team and witnessed the construction and infrastructure development activities in the area being expedited.    These illegal forest clearing activities are taking place in woods designated as a reserved forest under extraordinary gazette number 1759 / 2 dated 21st May 2012. President Maithripala Sirisena once stated that this illegal resettlement carried out based on political requirements of the previous government sets a wrong example. However, it can be seen that the president’s name has been used in providing infrastructure facilities such as electricity.  We further observed that construction activities are taking place in the area disregarding the orders made by President Maithripalaa Sirisena in May last year."

The act, which will come into effect from 1 April 2018, aims to simplify the tax laws and improve the efficiency of the system.\r\n \r\nDespite these positive reforms, Fitch said they see downside risks to the government's revenue projections, given a GDP growth assumption of 5%-6% for next year, compared with Fitch’s assumption of 4.5%.\r\n \r\nOn the expenditure side, the government expects public investment spending to rise by 20% in 2018, while recurring spending is forecast to decline.\r\n \r\nInterest payments are expected to account for more than one-third of total revenue, which is a key weakness in the fiscal profile.\r\n \r\nFitch also said Sri Lanka faces a challenging external debt service schedule in the near term, with very large external debt maturities coming up over 2019-22."
