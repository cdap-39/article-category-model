Responding to his comment, Clooney said that any attempt by a Maldivian diplomat to detain Nasheed in Sri Lanka would constitute a violation of international law as well as Sri Lankan criminal law. The report added that the Sri Lankan authorities have not responded to the development so far. Nasheed, 50, was the Maldives’s first democratically elected head of state and served four years as President. He was convicted in 2015 on terrorism charges following a trial that many, including the UN Group on Arbitrary Detention, criticized. In 2016, he flew to London on prison leave for medical treatment and was granted asylum soon after. Since then, he has been travelling frequently to Sri Lanka. In August 2016, he secretly flew from London to Colombo to firm up plans with fellow dissidents to unseat President Abdulla Yameen, but their attempt failed. (Source: The Hindu)"

During this period, evidence was being concocted fraudulently in Sri Lanka on blank sheets of paper, with signatures procured under false pretences and with financial inducements.

In August last year, the OMP Bill was bulldozed through Parliament by the UNP, the SLFP government group, the JVP and the TNA despite the objections raised by the Joint Opposition. Less than 40 minutes was allowed to debate this new law. I wish to draw the attention of the venerable members of the Maha Sangha to the following provisions of the Office of Missing Persons Act No: 14 of 2016 as amended by the Office on Missing Persons (Amendment) Act, No. 9 of 2017, which has just been given effect to, under the hand of the President:\r\n 1. Even though the body to be set up under this law is referred to as an ‘office’, Section 12 of the OMP Act makes it clear that it will in actual fact be a tribunal which can receive complaints, carry out investigations, examine witnesses, issue summons and hold hearings. Its officers can enter without warrant at any time of the day or night any police station, prison or military installation and seize any document or object they require. Anyone who fails or refuses to cooperate with the OMP may be punished as if it were an act of contempt against the Court of Appeal.\r\n2. Section 21 of the Act empowers the OMP to receive funding from any source local or foreign. Hence this body can receive funding from foreign governments, international NGOs and even from pro-LTTE Diaspora organisations that have not been banned.  \r\n3. Section 12 (c) (iii) of the Act allows the OMP to admit as evidence any statement or material disregarding all criteria laid down in the Evidence Ordinance. Disregarding the Evidence Ordinance will result in the common safeguards available even to the accused in ordinary criminal courts in this country being denied to those brought before the OMP.\r\n4. Under Section 12(e) of the Act, all government bodies including the armed forces and intelligence services have to submit all required information and documents to the OMP even in contravention of the Official Secrets Act.\r\n5. According to Section 15 of the Act, no court, not even the Supreme Court can order officers of the OMP to submit to courts any material communicated to them in confidence. The provisions of the Right to Information Act will also not apply to the Office of Missing Persons.\r\n6. Under Section 25 of the Act, all officers of the OMP have been granted complete immunity from civil and criminal liability for any act or omission on their part or the contents of any report they may publish. Nothing that the OMP does can be called into question by any court of law except the Supreme Court under Articles 126 and 140 of the constitution. However, as the OMP can withhold information under Section 15 of the Act, there will be no practical use in moving even the Supreme Court against the OMP.  \r\nUnder section 13(1)(i) of the Act, information gathered by the OMP can be referred to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authority. The Office of Missing Persons is one of several institutions that the yahapalana government has agreed to set up to ‘deal with the past’ in terms of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 of 14 October 2015, and its purpose is to feed information to other mechanisms. Recently, the government introduced a Bill to incorporate into local law the contents of the International Convention Against Enforced Disappearances which allows foreign countries to request the extradition of persons suspected of being responsible for enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka to be either tried in that foreign country or handed over to an international criminal tribunal for prosecution.\r\nThe debate on this Bill was postponed because of the objections raised by the Maha Sangha and the public. However the government has said that the withdrawal was only temporary and that this Bill will be reintroduced in Parliament in due course. It can be observed that the various laws being introduced by this government complement one another. The Office of Missing Persons (which will be funded and maintained by interested foreign parties) can make an allegation against an individual in a report and on that basis a foreign country can ask for the extradition of the suspect to be either tried in that country or handed over to an international criminal tribunal for prosecution. After the government was forced to postpone the debate on the Bill to give effect to the International Convention Against Enforced Disappearances, ministers of both the UNP and the SLFP were trying to justify that proposed law by saying that it will apply only to the future and not to the past.\r\nThat was an outright lie. If this law to give effect to the International Convention Against Enforced Disappearances had been passed by Parliament, under the proviso to Article 13(6) of our Constitution, it would have applied to the past automatically. The enthusiasm of the yahapalana political parties – the UNP, the SLFP group in the government, the TNA and the JVP to pass laws designed to punish members of the armed forces and the political authorities that gave leadership to the war is evident. The yahapalana government has sought to give interested foreign powers a central role under our own law, in the persecution of our armed forces through the new laws they have already passed or have placed before Parliament. I trust the Venerable Mahanayake Theras and the Maha Sangha will give due consideration to these acts of betrayal being committed under the guise of promoting reconciliation.\r\nMahinda Rajapaksa\r\nFormer President of Sri Lanka\r\n\r\n\r\n"

                "_source": {
                    "content": "\r\nSri Lanka's police forces regularly torture and ill-treat criminal suspects in custody, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today. The authorities should create an independent oversight authority and adopt concrete steps to end police abuse that has had such corrosive effects across Sri Lankan society.\r\n“The Sri Lankan police treat the use of torture as an ordinary way of obtaining confessions,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “The police regularly get away with using torture to falsely ‘resolve’ cases that really aren’t being resolved.”\r\nThe 59-page report, \"'We Live in Constant Fear' : Lack of Accountability for Police Abuse in Sri Lanka\", documents various torture methods used by the Sri Lankan police against criminal suspects, including severe beatings, electric shock, suspension from ropes in painful positions, and rubbing chili paste in the genitals and eyes. Victims of torture and their families may spend years seeking justice and redress with little hope of success.\r\nHuman Rights Watch conducted research in greater Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka in 2014 and 2015. Previous Human Rights Watch reports have focused on wartime abuses, including torture of minority Tamil civilians. This report documents how torture and police abuse are entrenched and devastating to the majority Sinhalese population as well.\r\nHuman Rights Watch’s findings are consistent with those of domestic human rights groups that have long worked on documenting torture in Sri Lanka’s police stations and jails.\r\nFor example, Gayan Rasanga died in police custody in 2011 after he was arrested on suspicion of theft. Rasanga’s mother said that when she went to the morgue, she saw her son’s body had “dark marks on his ankles. The soles of his feet looked like they had been burned. There were bruises on his hips, his nose was broken and bloody.”\r\n“AJ,” who was arrested on suspicion of theft in March 2015, said that police beat him to force a confession: “Within a minute I could feel my skin peeling, breaking. I was screaming very loudly from the pain. He kept saying that he knew that this was the way to get me to tell the truth.”\r\nThe history of police procedural violations against criminal suspects has contributed to the use of torture despite promises of reform by successive Sri Lankan governments. Suspects frequently are not informed about the reasons for their arrest. Police sometimes fabricate charges to justify the initial arrest and subsequent abusive interrogation methods. Suspects often are not produced before a magistrate within 24 hours as required by Sri Lankan law. Family members usually are not informed of an arrest or allowed access to their detained relatives. Suspects may have little or no access to lawyers, and protection mechanisms such as examination by medical officers are haphazard or improperly implemented.\r\n“One of the saddest things about these cases is that, although Sri Lanka has decent laws to protect against such abuse, these laws seem to be treated as mere suggestions and not as required police procedures,” Adams said. “Arbitrary arrest and other police mistreatment end up contributing to the use of torture. The police are meant to protect and uphold rights, not be the torchbearers of dismantling rights.”\r\nEven in cases where victims or their families were able to file complaints before the courts and other mechanisms, there has been only a remote chance of justice and accountability. Victims can file complaints against police abuse with the local courts, but lawyers and rights activists say that there are significant barriers to securing justice through this process, particularly in rural areas where the police engage in intimidation and threats against victims. In addition to court fees, there are regular court appearances and attorney fees for each appearance, and it typically takes years before cases are heard properly, if at all. Lawyers and rights activists advocating on behalf of the victims told Human Rights Watch that the police are allowed a wide discretionary berth by their superiors, the attorney general’s department, and the courts.\r\nSri Lanka’s new government took office in early 2015 on a promise of a wide array of reforms. To curtail the practices documented, the Sri Lankan government, at a minimum, should implement the following reforms:\r\nIssue clear, public directives that police torture and other forms of abuse will not be tolerated;\r\nEstablish an independent police oversight authority charged with investigating allegations of police abuse, the results of which would then be forwarded to the attorney general’s department for prosecution as appropriate. This authority should be housed entirely outside the police department, report to the Ministry of Justice, have all relevant authority to conduct investigations, including on its own authority, and be empowered to subpoena police, other witnesses, and police files;\r\nEstablish an independent office in the attorney general’s department tasked specifically with investigating and prosecuting cases of police abuse, including following up on referrals from the independent police oversight authority;\r\nAmend police rules and manuals to be consistent with the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions; the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials; and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;\r\nEnsure magistrates fully comply with their obligations to ascertain whether a detainee produced in court has suffered torture or other ill-treatment, and to order legislatively mandated confidential medical examinations; and\r\nFully implement the Convention against Torture in line with international obligations, and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.\r\n“The Sri Lankan police forces should immediately end the barbaric practice of torture, adhere to the rule of law, and act to earn the trust of the communities they serve,” Adams said. “That can only be achieved by taking strict measures against abuses, ensuring justice for the victims, and punishing the perpetrators – not simply by transferring them or suspending them, but through transparent and impartial prosecutions.”\r\n(Human Rights Watch)"

PRIO Director Henrik Urdal will publish an updated shortlist before the official announcement of this year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize the PRIO website said. The Peace Research Institute Oslo conducts research on the conditions for peaceful relations between states, groups and people. Based on independent assessments, PRIO Directors have offered their personal shortlists for the Nobel Peace Prize each year since 2002. Anyone can be nominated, but only a number of people have the right to nominate, including members of national assemblies and governments, current and former members of the Committee, Peace Prize laureates, professors of certain disciplines, directors of peace research and foreign policy institutes, and members of international courts. As such, the Director of PRIO holds the right to nominate, but refrains, given his active role as a commentator. The laureate is normally announced on the Friday of the first full week of October. Harpviken's 2017 Nobel Peace Prize Shortlist ·        The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Susan N. Herman·        The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)·        Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka·        The White Helmets (Syrian Civil Defense) and Raed al Saleh·        Jeanne Nacatche Banyere, Jeannette Kahindo Bindu and Dr Denis Mukwege The reasons mentioned by the PRIO to nominate Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena: \"President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena has initiated a comprehensive set of reconciliatory initiatives to heal the wounds of the civil war which culminated in a military onslaught by the state military on the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in 2009. Sirisena’s insistence on inclusive reconciliation, therefore, stands out as an example to be followed, especially in a situation where support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other transitional justice mechanisms is deteriorating. In early 2017, the Sri Lankan Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms released its final report. This goes hand in hand with a range of other efforts, including a consultative process on constitutional reform. Resistance from the political opposition is real, and so are the prospects for failure. The President himself is susceptible to criticism, having held posts with the former government that overran the LTTE. A Nobel Peace Prize to President Sirisena would fit a tradition of honouring pragmatic leaders who show political courage, and it would draw attention to reconciliation as a key to sustainable peace\"."

The presence of Deputy Secretary Blinken and Mayor Bowser on this important day for Sri Lanka, especially at a unique and decisive time for the country, is a manifestation of the goodwill and friendship of the United States towards Sri Lanka and a singular honour to its people and leaders as well as Sri Lankan-Americans living in the United States, the Ambassador said. Ambassador Kariyawasam recalled the long years of friendship that Sri Lanka shared with the United States. He added that Sri Lanka looks forward to strengthen bonds of friendship and cooperation with the United States on the basis of our shared values, our commitment to democracy, good governance and to international peace and security.The Ambassador read out the Government’s collective pledge to peace, which was applauded by the audience and Deputy Secretary Blinken remarked it “was an important step towards healing [the] country’s wounds.”In the morning of 4 February, the Ambassador and the Embassy staff hosted the traditional Independence Day ceremony at the Embassy premises with multi-faith religious observances conducted by religious dignitaries representing the Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Islam faiths and in the presence of representatives of the Sri Lankan community in Washington DC."

                    "content": "The European Union has re-emphasized its clear and unwavering expectation that urgent action would be taken by the Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and replace it with legislation that is in line with international standards.This message was conveyed in a joint statement which was released following the conclusion of the 21st meeting of the European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission in Colombo today (Jan. 18).Plans to resolve as soon as possible the situation of the remaining detainees held under the PTA were discussed. In addition, there was a discussion of the need to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to ensure fundamental legal safeguards.The Foreign Ministry said that the 21st meeting of the Joint Commission was held in an open and constructive spirit. The EU and Sri Lanka welcomed the formal restoration of the GSP Plus regime to Sri Lanka in May 2017, providing duty-free access for more than 80% of Sri Lankan exports to the European Union, the world's largest economy, and Sri Lanka's largest export market. Sri Lanka stated that initial indications showed that the restoration of GSP Plus had contributed to a near doubling of export growth. The trade preferences scheme was restored in recognition of the progress made by Sri Lanka in implementing the 27 international conventions listed in the GSP Regulation relating to human rights, labour, good governance and the environment.The EU representatives have welcomed Sri Lanka’s recent accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.However, they said that the Government of Sri Lanka must ensure that the policy of zero-tolerance for the use of torture is implemented and that perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice. The European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission oversees the 1995 EU-Sri Lanka Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development.Its tasks include ensuring the implementation of the Agreement; setting mutually agreed priorities; and making constructive recommendations. The Commission accordingly deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest to the EU and Sri Lanka.The Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law, and Human Rights, the Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation Issues, and the Working Group on Development Cooperation–established under the terms of the Joint Commission–held meetings in the last year. Each Working Group reported back to the Joint Commission on their respective meetings.Following the meeting, both parties said that they would remain committed to continuing bilateral discussions through the respective Working Groups and the GSP+ monitoring process with a view to further strengthening the implementation of the provisions of the 27 conventions.The accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, and adoption of a National Human Rights Action Plan, as well as the acceptance of the vast majority of recommendations received during the third cycle of its Universal Periodic Review in November 2017, were welcomed by both parties as evidence of Sri Lanka’s continued commitment to reform.The meeting also provided an opportunity to exchange views on the implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolutions of 1 October 2015 and 23 March 2017.The parties noted the progress made with respect to the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons. They also noted Sri Lanka’s reaffirmed commitment to establishing the remaining mechanisms aimed at truth-seeking, reconciliation, reparation, and justice, on which the EU urged for prompt action. Progress with regard to the enactment of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, unmet expectations of justice in the 'emblematic cases', the further release of land, and the normalization of civilian life in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, were discussed during the meeting. Sri Lanka also provided updates on the ongoing constitutional reform process, and measures to combat corruption.The parties agreed on a series of follow-up actions ahead of the next Joint Commission meeting in Brussels later in the year.The meeting was co-chaired by Paola Pampaloni, Deputy Managing Director for Asia and Pacific of the European External Action Service, and Prasad Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka."

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) stated yesterday (23) at a media brief that abducting persons in Defender vehicles is not good governance.

If someone is misusing Parliamentary privileges’ or other powers and abducting civil youths in Black Defenders it’s completely wrong. That was started during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. MP Hirunika Premachandra grew up in that back ground. It proves nothing has changed. It has not changed yet.

Instead of an incorrect white Van culture Black Defender culture has come.\r\nA campaign of abducting youths in black defenders who go against parliamentarian has begun. Defender and the body guards who abducted is the parliamentarian’s as well. And even the office. The abducted person accuse that the parliamentarian assaulted and threatened. She also accepts that she was involved in it.\r\nBut the law is not enforced properly on the Parliamentarian. Others are arrested while the parliamentarian is free. We are compelled to ask the government whether is this good governance when the parliamentarian is kept above the law.\r\nA strong evidence has already been revealed by now which connects the Parliamentarian (MP) Hirunika Premachandra to the incident. The main fact being the defender which was used in the abduction belonged to her. Also the abductors taking the abducted person to Hirunika’s office proves to be another evidence…..\r\n  -----Evidence against Hirunika Premachandra by now in connection with this abduction------\r\n\r\nProof that the abduction was carried out in the defender vehicle which belonged to her.\r\nThe abducted person being taken to her office situated in Kolonnawa\r\nThe abducted person being threatened by her\r\nThe abducted Amila Priyanga Amarasinghe relating the incident……\r\n\r\nThe abducted Amila Priyanga Amarasinghe describing the incident…………..\r\n“They pulled me and went…assaulted on the head…punched me in the stomach….

Having said that I do not know whether Yositha is guilty or innocent until the court decides. Since it is an ongoing legal case I prefer not to refer to it in any way.\r\nMr Rajakaksa, I may sympathize with your circumstances but when you start dragging my good name in to the mud, when I am not involved in any of your present political problems, is when my sympathy turns to disgust. You were our former Executive President, but yet you slander me without any basis, simply because your son has been arrested.\r\nI remember during the last General Election you resorted to doing the same. I did not arrest your son Mr. Rajapaksa, nor did I make you lose the election, you did it all by yourself with the help of your family.\r\nMy revered parents President Premadasa and Mrs Hema Premadasa, did a stellar job in raising my brother and myself to respect and uphold the law of God and the law of the Land. I did not need your supposed advice about leading an upright lifestyle because my parents carried out that duty brilliantly. You should advice your children as their parent about leading their lives in a manner, whichbefits their position in society.\r\nMy brother and I were also a Prime Minister’s children and an Executive President’s children who never even imagined abusing our positions. Young as we were, our mother always reminded us that our father was a public servant while holding the offices of Prime Minister and President.\r\nMr Rajapaksa, you are well aware as I that I am innocent. You seem to think that you have a right to play around with my name when you have run out of excuses. This is unacceptable and dishonourable. If you are a credible lawyer you should know that I am not an accused and that this particular matter is an on-going court case and as such legally we cannot discuss it. Even you, now, must adhere to the law of our country.\r\nMy late father’s service and dedication to this country is unparalleled to any of his predecessors or successors. Whether you agree or not is of no importance. I know you attempted to match my late father’s achievements and the few instances I have briefly spoken with you, if you recall, I have said that you were not even close to achieving it but I had commended you on your attempts to serve our country and stop the war. Let me remind you that you were successful in ending the war because your predecessors had laid the foundation for you to do so. Do I need to remind you that my dear father was assassinated by the LTTE? To date my late father is the highest ranking Sri Lankan who was a victim of terrorists. This shocked the International Community so much that the support for the LTTE started to wane. This happened because President Premadasa lived and worked for the masses without hiding in ‘palaces’.\r\nMr Rajapaksa, one must face situations and not hide behind baseless accusations directed at innocent people. I would like to request you to please uphold your dignity and desist from making such comments again. I am aware that this is not the first time you have done it and this is not the first time I have requested you not to do it. I sincerely hope and trust that this will be the last.\r\nWhenever your children’s activities are questioned by legal authorities, press and the law abiding citizens of this country, it is not right for a former President like you to duck and dodge without giving viable explanations. All you have done recently is to throw mud at me. You told me personally then, that I was the victim of the crime and not the criminal.\r\nFurthermore, your false and arrogant claims of your letting me free when according to you, I was wrong, tantamount to a serious crime which can place you in jail for interfering in the course of justice and a police investigation.\r\nFinally, let me remind you again that this matter is before COURTS and is accordingly subjudice and any comment on this is liable for contempt of court.\r\nPlease convey my regards to Mrs Rajapaksa.\r\nDulanjalee Premadasa.\r\n"

All necessary medical documents are furnished to the relevant doctors and proper authorities and his condition is known to his doctors who did his surgeries in Sri Lanka and Singapore. Anyone can make accusations but I think we all should take a step back and see what rights and facilities prisoners requiring medical attention should be given as per the prison ordinance of Sri Lanka and as per the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules). What’s been dramatically highlighted in media about medical consultation, treatment and bedding are basic facilities which must be supplied to prisoners upon consultation of a doctor as set out in these legal documents. What highlighted even more is the fact of medical confidentiality which should be maintained. How can anyone report these unless one has permission from the patient only. Even the right to information act does not permit anyone to have access to anyone’s medical documents and say it out in public or on media unless these medical documents are required by law. \r\n \r\nAs per the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) \r\n \r\nHealth-care services \r\n \r\nRule 24 \r\n1.

                    "content": "The UN report published today has identified patterns of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, strongly indicating that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe report recommends the establishment of a hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, as an essential step towards justice.\r\n\r\nThe UNHRC Commissioner further reiterated several factors.\r\n\r\nHe said the commitment of the new government to conduct a domestic investigation is laudable. \r\n\r\nHowever Sri Lankan Judicial system, particularly in three areas, is not ready to investigate such alleged crimes.\r\n\r\nThe country’s judicial system has no trustworthy provisions to safeguard the victims and witnesses. \r\n\r\nThe second is lack of a domestic law framework to investigate international crimes.\r\n\r\nThe third challenge pointed out by the Commissioner is the corrupt and spoilt security personnel and the judiciary due to emergency situation, conflict and impunity.\r\n\r\nThe charges leveled against Sri Lanka by the UNHRC are listed under 8 categories.\r\n\r\nAmong them are: Unlawful killings, sexual and gender based violence, enforced disappearance, torture and other forms of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment, recruitment of children and their use in hostilities, attacks on civilians and civilian objects and denial of humanitarian assistance.\r\nUpdate : Wednesday, 16 September 2015 - 19:09----------------------------------------------------------UN report confirms patterns of grave violations; Zeid urges creation of hybrid special court in Sri LankaThe UN report published today has identified patterns of grave violations in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, strongly indicating that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict. The report recommends the establishment of a hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, as an essential step towards justice.\r\n“Our investigation has laid bare the horrific level of violations and abuses that occurred in Sri Lanka, including indiscriminate shelling, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, harrowing accounts of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes,” High Commissioner Zeid said. “Importantly, the report reveals violations that are among the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.”\r\n“This report is being presented in a new political context in Sri Lanka, which offers grounds for hope,” Zeid said. “It is crucial that this historic opportunity for truly fundamental change is not allowed to slip.”\r\nAmong the most serious crimes documented in the report are the following:\r\n\r\nUnlawful killings: Numerous unlawful killings between 2002 and 2011, were allegedly committed by both parties, as well as by paramilitary groups linked to the security forces. Tamil politicians, humanitarian workers, journalists and ordinary civilians were among the alleged victims of Sri Lankan security forces and associated paramilitaries. There appear to have been discernible patterns of killings, for instance, in the vicinity of security force checkpoints and military bases, and also of extrajudicial killings of individuals while in the custody of security forces, including people who were captured or surrendered at the end of the conflict. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) also reportedly killed Tamil, Muslim and Sinhalese civilians, through indiscriminate suicide bombings and mine attacks, as well as assassinations of individuals including public officials, academics and dissenting Tamil political figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual and gender-based violence: One shocking finding of the investigation was the extent to which sexual violence was committed against detainees, often extremely brutally, by the Sri Lankan security forces, with men as likely to be victims as women. Harrowing testimony from 30 survivors of sexual violence who were interviewed indicates that incidents of sexual violence were not isolated acts but part of a deliberate policy to inflict torture, following similar patterns and using similar tools. The report describes sexual torture which occurred during interrogation sessions, and also patterns of rape, much of which appeared to occur outside of interrogations sessions. Sexual torture was performed in a wide range of detention locations by different security forces, both during and after the conflict. Not a single perpetrator of sexual violence related to the armed conflict is so far known to have been convicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnforced disappearances: Enforced disappearances affected tens of thousands of Sri Lankans for decades, including throughout the 26-year armed conflict with the LTTE. There are reasonable grounds to believe that enforced disappearances may have been committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population. In particular, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a large number of individuals who surrendered during the final phase of the war were disappeared, and remain unaccounted for. Many others, including people not directly linked to the conflict, disappeared, typically after abduction in ‘white vans.’ \r\n\r\n\r\nTorture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: Brutal use of torture by the Sri Lankan security forces was widespread throughout the decade covered by the report, and in particular during the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Some of the more commonly used centres had rooms that were set up with torture equipment, illustrating the premeditated and systematic nature of the use of torture. These rooms contained objects including metal bars and poles for beatings, barrels of water used for waterboarding, and pulleys from which victims were suspended. Victims interviewed for the report described seeing bloodstains on the walls or floors of these rooms, and described their own torture in detail.\r\nRecruitment of children and their use in hostilities, as well as abduction and forced recruitment of adults: Information indicates patterns of abductions leading to forced recruitment of adults by the LTTE, which intensified towards the end of the conflict. Extensive recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by the LTTE and by the paramilitary Karuna group, which supported the Government following its spilt from the LTTE in 2004, was also documented.  Children were often recruited by force from homes, schools, temples and checkpoints, and, after basic training were sent to the frontlines. According to numerous reports, in the last few months of the conflict, the LTTE increasingly recruited children below the age of 15. These practices would amount to war crimes if established in a court of law. \r\nAttacks on civilians and civilian objects: There are reasonable grounds to believe that many attacks during the last phase of the war did not comply with international humanitarian law principles on the conduct of hostilities, particularly the principle of distinction. The report documents repeated shelling by Government forces of hospitals and humanitarian facilities in the densely populated ‘No Fire Zones,’ which the Government itself had announced but which were inside areas controlled by the LTTE. Directing attacks against civilian objects and/or against civilians not taking direct part in hostilities is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and may amount to a war crime. The presence of LTTE cadres directly participating in hostilities and operating within the predominantly civilian population, launching attacks from close proximity of these locations, and the LTTE policy of forcing civilians to remain within areas of active hostilities, may also have violated international humanitarian law. However, this would not have absolved the Government of its own responsibilities under international humanitarian law. The duty to respect international humanitarian law does not depend on the conduct of the opposing party, and is not conditioned on reciprocity. \r\nDenial of humanitarian assistance: There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Government placed considerable restrictions on freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel and activities, and may have deliberately blocked the delivery of sufficient food aid and medical supplies in the Vanni in the Northern Province, which may amount to the use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare. Such conduct, if proven in a court of law, may constitute a war crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViolations during the detention of internally displaced people (IDPs) in closed camps: The manner in which the screening processes were carried out, to separate former LTTE combatants from civilians, failed to meet international standards and facilitated ill-treatment and abuse. Almost 300,000 IDPs were deprived of their liberty in camps for periods far beyond what is permissible under international law. There are also reasonable grounds to believe that IDPs were treated as suspects and detained because of their Tamil ethnicity. This may amount to discrimination and the crime against humanity of “persecution.”\r\n\r\nThe report documents years of denials and cover-ups, failure to carry out prompt investigations, stalled investigations and reprisals against the family members of victims and others who have pushed for justice. \r\nIt notes that the repeated failure of successive domestic inquiries to bring justice has led to scepticism, anger and mistrust on the part of victims, particularly since “many of the structures responsible for the violations and crimes remain in place.” The report demonstrates the systemic weakness in addressing these crimes, especially when the military or security forces are involved. It also describes “reprisals against judicial and other professionals who try to prosecute human-rights related cases involving State officials.”\r\n“The commitment by the new Government  to pursue accountability through a domestic process is commendable…but the unfortunate reality is that Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system is not yet ready,” the report states. “First and foremost is the absence of any reliable system for victim and witness protection. Second is the inadequacy of Sri Lanka’s domestic legal framework to deal with international crimes of this magnitude. The third challenge is the degree to which Sri Lanka’s security sector and justice system have been distorted and corrupted by decades of emergency, conflict and impunity.”\r\nThe High Commissioner welcomed the positive steps taken by the new Government of President Mathiripala Sirisena since January this year, but said that “Sri Lanka must now move forward to dismantle the repressive structures and institutional cultures that remain deeply entrenched after decades of erosion of human rights.”\r\n“This will not happen overnight, and no one should underestimate the enormity of the task,” he said. “We have seen many moments in Sri Lanka’s history when governments pledged to turn the page and end practices like enforced disappearances, but the failure to address impunity and root out the systemic problems that allowed such abuses to occur meant that the ‘white vans’ could be, and were, reactivated when needed. It is imperative that the Government seizes the unique opportunity it has to break the mold of impunity once and for all. This means there must be a root-and-branch transformation of the ways in which institutions and officials operate.”\r\nThe report recommends a range of measures to develop a comprehensive transitional justice policy to address the human rights violations of the past 30 years and prevent their recurrence.\r\nThe High Commissioner urged all communities and sections of society, including the diaspora, to view the report as “an opportunity to change discourse from one of absolute denial to one of acknowledgment and constructive engagement to bring about change.”\r\n“After so many years of unbridled human rights violations and institutionalized impunity, the wounds of victims on both sides have festered and deepened,” Zeid said. “Unless fundamentally addressed, their continued suffering will further polarize and become an obstacle to reconciliation, and – worse – may sow the seeds for further conflict.”\r\n“The levels of mistrust in State authorities and institutions by broad segments of Sri Lankan society should not be underestimated,” the High Commissioner said. “It is for this reason that the establishment of a hybrid special court, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators, is so essential.  A purely domestic court procedure will have no chance of overcoming widespread and justifiable suspicions fuelled by decades of violations, malpractice and broken promises.”\r\n“The domestic criminal justice system also needs to be strengthened and reformed, so it can win the confidence of the public, but that is a process which will take several years to achieve and needs to be undertaken in parallel to the establishment of a special hybrid court, not in place of it. Indeed such a court may help stimulate the reforms needed to set Sri Lanka on a new path to justice, building public confidence along the way.”\r\nThe UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) was mandated by the UN Human Rights Council last year to conduct a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period 2002-11. The investigation report is based on eye-witness testimony, interviews with victims and witnesses, video and photographic material including satellite imagery (much of which is not in the public domain) that was analyzed by forensic and military experts, and an extensive review of documentation, including about 3,000 written statements and submissions, as well as previously unpublished reports. The OHCHR investigation team was not granted access to Sri Lanka and faced other constraints, including the previous Government’s use of threats, intimidation and surveillance to prevent people, particularly in the north of the country, from cooperating with the investigation.\r\n\r\nUpdate : Wednesday, 16 September 2015 - 15:15----------------------------------------------------------Live: UN Report ReleasedThe UN report on Sri Lanka exploring the violations occurred in Sri Lanka between 2002 and 2011, indicate that war crimes and crimes against humanity were most likely committed by both sides to the conflict, UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said a short while ago as the report on Sri Lanka was made public.\r\nThe OISL was directed at the UNHRC in March 2014 through US Sponsored resolution 25/1, which requested the High Commissioner to  ‘undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.’  The recommendations of the OISL report included a call for a hybrid court to address war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict. \r\n\r\nUpdate : Wednesday, 16 September 2015 - 14:49----------------------------------------------------------Human Rights Report on Sri Lanka to the Geneva summit todayThe United Nations said that the report on Sri Lanka will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council at around 2PM Sri Lanka time today.Media Spokesperson of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Raveena Shaam Desani expressed these views in an exclusive interview with our news team.However, the Ministry of External Affairs stated that they were planning in submitting the response by the 30th of this month after considering the contents of the UN report which will be released today."
